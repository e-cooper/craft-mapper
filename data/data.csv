oMNpgF,C.H. Evans Brewing Company,"The Evans family was in the commercial brewing business for three generations. The original brewery was built in Hudson, NY in 1786. It continued production until prohibition in 1920. Its award winning ales were well known in the Northeast and were even exported to England and France. Production levels peaked in 1915 when 65,000 barrels of beer were produced at the Hudson Facility.    The brewery bottled its own beer in Hudson at one of the country’s earliest bottling facilities (1889) and later at a plant in New York City. The family also malted much of their own grain in their malt houses at the Hudson facility. Neil Evans revives this rich heritage here at the Albany Pump Station. Surviving C.H.

HeStKS,Potosi Brewing Company,"Founded in 1852 by Gabriel Hail and John Albrecht, the Potosi Brewery began as a small brewery quenching the thirsts of area farmers, fishermen and miners. In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.    The restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.    In 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.",http://www.potosibrewery.com/,1852,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_DbScRK-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_DbScRK-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_DbScRK-large.png,209 South Main Street,Potosi,Wisconsin,53820,42.6716654,-90.7271709,608-763-4002,,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,1852,

Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it’s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That’s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don’t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn’t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn’t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, “it is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.",http://www.flyingdogales.com/,1983,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmGoBA/upload_0z9L4W-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmGoBA/upload_0z9L4W-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmGoBA/upload_0z9L4W-large.png,4607 Wedgewood Blvd,Frederick,Maryland,21703,39.361926,-77.424677,301-694-7899,"Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).",Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,1983,

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an ""Entrepreneur of the Year"" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.    Jim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.    One of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: ""What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?""    Each year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, ""I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America."" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.

TkT8Rc,Dick's Brewing Company,"Dick Young started brewing as a home brewer in 1984 and sold homebrew supplies at his business, Northwest Sausage & Deli.  When he wasn’t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick’s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick’s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick’s Brewing Company became a reality.    Dick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, “I started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty”.   And we are all so grateful he was.    The brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick’s Beers were flying out the door.  In 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.    Dick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.    Today, the Dick’s Brew Crew is led by Dick’s daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick’s legacy.  All of us here at Dick’s are proud to continue the dream that our founder started, and we are proud to have you all along for the ride.",http://dicksbeer.com/,1984,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_vNkqm1-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_vNkqm1-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_vNkqm1-large.png,5945 Prather Road,Centralia,Washington,98531,46.771347,-123.007543,800-586-7760,Fridays 3pm - 7pm,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,1984,

krIs45,Alaskan Brewing Company,"Alaska has a rich history of brewing. From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.    In 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.    Marcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. ""Why not start a brewery?"" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.    Maybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.    While researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.    In December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.",http://www.alaskanbeer.com/,1986,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_32dIr0-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_32dIr0-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_32dIr0-large.png,5429 Shaune Drive,Juneau,Alaska,99801,58.3570171,-134.4893459,907-780-5866,"Mon:  8:00am - 5:00pm Tue:  11:00am - 5:00pm  Business hours:  8 a.m. - 5 p.m., Monday - Friday    Gift shop and tour hours:  Winter Hours: October - April: 11 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., Tuesday - Saturday  Summer Hours: May - September: 11 a.m. - 6 p.m., 7 days a week",Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,1986,

So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers.

Rs3OQM,Weeping Radish Farm Brewery,"The Weeping Radish is the Oldest Microbrewery in North Carolina. 25 years ago it was illegal for breweries to sell their own beer directly to consumers; they had to go through a distributor. This made it impossible for microbreweries or small brewpubs to exist. In 1985 Uli Bennewitz went to his local senator and together they passed a bill allowing microbreweries to sell their own beer on site. A year later on the July 4th, 1986 the Weeping Radish Brewery opened for business.      Raised in a small village in Bavaria, Uli was determined to bring the high quality beer he was used to across the ocean to North Carolina. A Master Brewer came over from Germany and brewed the first batches of Corolla Gold, Fest, and Black Radish. Strictly adhering to the Reinheitsgebot Purity Law of 1516, all Weeping Radish beers are brewed using hops, malt, yeast and water â€“ no additives, chemicals or preservatives.      Our beer list has expanded over the years and currently on draft in the pub we have the OBX KÃ¶lsch, IPA 25, and Radler as well as our original Corolla Gold, Fest and Black Radish.

N39Q0L,Rubicon Brewing Company,"For 22 years, the Rubicon Brewing Company has been a jewel of a capital city culture. It’s not just because of the award-winning fine ales and great food served up by the Rubicon. Within the past four years, under the auspices of owner Glynn Phillips, the Rubicon has become renowned for its community outreach and philanthropic efforts. It’s support for Sacramento kids and various people in need that has transformed the Rubicon into a vital cog of Sacramento life.    “This pub is part of the community, and I don’t just mean geographically,” said Glynn Phillips, owner of the Rubicon since June 2005. “It’s important for us to give back as much as we can to show our appreciation. I really feel like we’re connected with the people and that they can trust that they’ll feel at home here.”    Brewmaster Scott Cramlet has felt so at home that he’s stayed more than two decades. In October 2006, he experienced a thrill very few craft brewers achieve in their careers: stepping on stage to receive a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival. Cramlet won for his Winter Wheatwine, and followed that achievement with a silver GABF medal in 2009. In the craft brewing industry, consistent victories in the respected blind-panel tasting contest bring international acclaim.    “We’ve gone through so many different phases during my time here, but we’re very happy with things right now,” he said. “There is a lot of hope for future and expanding our business. We hope to double our capacity and get more of our products in bottles and more of a market presence -- not too huge but bigger than we are now. I’m certainly very proud to work for a place that has been around so long and has its place in history. We are not the new kid on street. I tell people how long I’ve been at the Rubicon, and I hear people say, ‘Wow, that’s impressive.’”    In some ways, the transition from founder Ed Brown to Phillips was more than a decade in the making. Brown had known Phillips since the 1970s as the good friend of Brown’s nephews in the Bay Area town of Moraga. As Phillips paid his dues in the craft brewing industry – first at Great Basin Brewing in Sparks, Nev., and next at Marin Brewing in Larkspur – Phillips kept in close contact with Brown. Buoyed by his management experience at Marin Brewing, Phillips was confident that he could handle the passing of the baton at the Rubicon.",http://www.rubiconbrewing.com/,1987,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iBzEfC/upload_9rcK7S-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iBzEfC/upload_9rcK7S-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iBzEfC/upload_9rcK7S-large.png,2004 Capitol Avenue,Sacramento,California,95814,38.573116,-121.480958,916-448-7032,Monday - Thrusday: 11am to 11:30pm  Friday & Saturday: 11am to 12:30am  Sunday: 11am to 10pm,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,1987,

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm).

He took Dani and the three kids to meet the owner of the property, Al Walters. Mr. Walters took an immediate liking to the Jones family and allowed Dani and Larry to sell produce from his corner. Being a farmer, he even started growing corn and other vegetables for them. One day, Larry's father showed up with a bushel of live crabs and left them with Dani to sell. The crabs sold so fast that they picked up more crabs, shrimp, and other types of seafood too. In 1994, Mr. Walters passed away and Dani and Larry had to move on to bigger and better things. They rented a space in the Chalfont Village Shopping Center and opened a restaurant and fresh fish market. Dani and Larry did all the cooking. Larry would go to the fish market daily to ensure the freshest seafood. And with the help of loyal family and friends, Jones Family Seafood became a popular seafood restaurant in the area.      Early in 2001, Larry received a mailing, the kind we all ignore, advertising ""Brew your own beer"". He was immediately hooked.

I came up with a process that allows me to get a rather large amount of body, equivalent to the body of an IPA, but with the finish of a light beer.”    “We’re bringing beer to the market that ale drinkers will enjoy, because they’re going to be different and flavorful, and we’ll grab some of the mainstream drinkers. Take my son,” Duenwald says. “He’s in his 30s, living in Seattle. He’ll start the night out drinking a Mac & Jack’s or a Mirror Pond. He might even have two of them.

A microbrewery was in the original plans for the business but was not feasible at the time due to the high cost of equipment and space.  The Wildflower Café had enormous success, which helped the inspiration for the Crooked Rooster Brewpub’s opening in 1998, again founded by Doug Thayer.  Throughout the running of these side-by-side businesses, Doug always had brewing on his mind and began to experiment in 2002 with home brewing.  Receiving excellent feedback on his brews from several beer aficionados, Roosterfish Brewing’s first official beer, Black Walnut Nut Brown Ale (now known as Original Nut Brown Ale) was unveiled at the Crooked Rooster and Wildflower Café in 2004.  This was shortly followed with the Butternut Pale Ale, now known as Dog Tooth Pale Ale.

Traveling through the upper Susquehanna Valley towards Cooperstown in July 1898, a visitor would have enjoyed the view of hop farms with those beautiful hop vines reaching toward the midsummer sky. Grandfather Eckler ws a hop farmer and he used to say, ""The hop was King in those days!"" His hop farm was in Westville, NY only three miles up the Cherry Valley from where our Brewery is now located. When it came time for the hops to be harvested, Grandma Eckler would ""put up"" a dozen people from ""the City' and they would pick the hops for their room and board and a ""vacation"" in the country. My mother, Cynthia Eckler Hall, said she always loved it when the hop pickers came to the farm. Everyone had a lot of fun during the harvest. When the blight devastated his crop in the early 1900's, grandfather turned to dairy farming.  Settled by Englishmen in the early 1800's, Cooperstown once had two English-style breweries in town. Following that tradition, the Cooperstown Brewing Company was founded in 1994. We brew premium ales, porters, and stouts using the finest two-row English barley malts, West Coast hops and the English Ringwood Yeast.    Grandpa would be pleased if he could see the Brewery.

In 1997 Elysian was chosen to operate a pub and small brewery at Gameworks—a large entertainment complex owned by Universal Studios, Dreamworks & Sega. Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery/bistro. With a 3-bbl pilot brewery, Elysian-TangleTown acted as the brewers' test kitchen, fueling the creative fires and helping cement Elysian's reputation as Seattle’s top brewpub. The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle’s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays.

qjZIZq,Flying Fish Brewing Company,"When Gene Muller founded Flying Fish Brewing Co. in 1995, he did so first on the World Wide Web - making it the world's first virtual microbrewery. That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site “This Old House meets the World Wide Web”—letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.    He also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.    Muller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order).    Flying Fish Brewing Company is located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century.

Qs29uy,Brewer's Alley Restaurant & Brewery,"Welcome to Brewer’s Alley, Frederick, Maryland’s first Brewpub. Brewer’s Alley is proud to continue the long history of beer making in a town known for its deep appreciation of fine fermented spirits.    Brewer’s Alley was located on what is currently South Court Street. Beer Production ceased in 1901 when a large fire consumed the brewery of John Kuhn, who was the last in a long line of brewers to occupy space along the banks of Carroll Creek. For over 153 years, from the very beginning of Frederick County, Brewer’s Alley was a fixture in the social and economic landscape of Frederick. Ninety-five years after leaving Frederick, Brewer’s Alley is back!    Brewer’s Alley’s location at 124 North Market Street is steeped in Frederick history. The first residents of Frederick held a lottery to raise money to build a town hall and market house on this location in 1765, which was completed in 1769. This structure served its purpose for over 100 years and was witness to the birth of Frederick as a city. The Market House spanned the Civil War, including the ransoming of the city by Confederate General Jubal Early.    In 1873, the bustling town of Frederick replaced the Market House with the ""new"" multifunctional offices, and provided space in the rear for the Frederick Farmer’s Market. Later, the rear of the building was replaced by the present parking deck; the first of it’s kind in town.    As the seat of city government the building was witness to Frederick’s political history, and as an opera house and theatre it has been witness to much of Frederick’s social and entertainment history. The building has hosted such diverse events as a Memorial Service for President McKinley in 1901, the Frederick debut of D.W. Griffith’s film ""The Birth of a Nation"", and the Manhattan Opera Company’s production of ""Madame Butterfly"", in 1926. It also hosted the popular American Legion fundraisers immediately after World War I, and the family pleasers the Mykle and Harden Fair Week Road Shows.    Brewer’s Alley has been fortunate in its efforts to preserve the elegance and glory of the old Opera House by being able to engage Salyer Studio Faux to faux decorate some of the original ceiling panels and columns in mimicked old Italian Sienna marble. The beautiful and captivating glass etching work and stained glass seen throughout the building done by Rusty and Sharon Rowland’s Art in Glass Studio complements this fine craftsmanship. Their rendition of the hop vines on the brewery glass and the stain glass panels in the back dinning room was all done by hand and is a joy to behold.    We are most happy to oversee the building’s latest transformation into the state-of-the-art brewery and restaurant. We hope you enjoy the history and ambiance of our location, as well as the brewery and dining experience.    We opened the doors in July of 1996 and have been serving great beers and wonderful meals to the masses ever since.",http://www.brewers-alley.com,1996,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_8Bijgx-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_8Bijgx-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_8Bijgx-large.png,124 North Market Street,Frederick,Maryland,21701,39.4156043,-77.4107676,301-631-0089,,Y,N,N,Y,brewpub,Brewpub,US,United States,USA,1996,

Ramstein beers are made with the same care and precision that Greg learned in Germany. In fact, the wheat, barley, hops and yeast used to make Ramstein Beers are all imported directly from Bavaria.    Greg found a special brewer’s yeast used only by a small brewery in Bavaria. He was able to get the brewery to let him use the special yeast exclusively at High Point. The unique, complex character of Ramstein beers is a result of this private yeast and of course, High Point’s careful and proper brewing methods.    The name Ramstein was adopted from a town in Germany with a large American population. The town surrounds the U.S. Ramstein Air Force Base. High Point wanted the name of its beers to reflect a marriage of German tradition and American innovation.

5tw2Iw,Angel City Brewing,"Angel City Brewery is excited to be part of the brewing renaissance of Downtown LA by bringing old-world, small-batch, craft brewing to the new world of the expanding Arts District. We are committed to the continued growth and revitalization of our neighborhood by being an interactive and supportive partner to the arts and business communities, as well as the burgeoning craft beer movement in Los Angeles.    Angel City Brewing was founded in 1997. Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA’s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great city a great brewery.    On January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.    Since January 2012, we’ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.    In February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out. In addition to the neighborhood cuisine, our parking lot has become a hot spot for food trucks, with one parked outside nearly every night we’re open. On May 5th, 2013 we had our grand opening with our first ever Heritage Festival.

DrFlD0,Carlsbad,"Back in March of 1987 Gina and Vince Marsaglia, a pair of siblings in their 20?s, bought a struggling pizza place in the sleepy coastal town of Solana Beach, just north of San Diego. From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the “Pizza Port” with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own “San Diego” twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach    The parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge décor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn’t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite.     Early on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant’s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992.     Embracing the same “flavor-driven” principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego’s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival “Small Brewpub of the Year”.     The Pizza Port family’s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named “Large Brewpub of the Year”.",http://www.pizzaport.com/locations/carlsbad/,1987,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QSVVxD/upload_Yqeh6Z-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QSVVxD/upload_Yqeh6Z-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QSVVxD/upload_Yqeh6Z-large.png,571 Carlsbad Village Dr.,Carlsbad,California,92008,33.1596505,-117.3478111,760-720-7007,,N,N,N,Y,brewpub,Brewpub,US,United States,USA,1997,

MfINpl,SweetWater Brewing Company,"February 17, 1997 marked the official beginning of SweetWater Brewery, and a new style of brewing and selling beer in Atlanta as the boys wandered around Atlanta in an old van with Freddy's dog Badger. After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. ""We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio"" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.    SweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in. Our new home has enough capacity to brew 100,000 barrels of beer a year (A few more years at this rate.)",http://www.sweetwaterbrew.com/,1997,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_HkHhYQ-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_HkHhYQ-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TMc6H2/upload_HkHhYQ-large.png,195 Ottley Drive,Atlanta,Georgia,30324,33.808102,-84.38119,404-691-2537,,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,1997,

C6iHOv,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Tröegs Brewing Company was established in 1997 by brothers Chris and John Trogner. Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tröegs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale).     In addition to these beers, Tröegs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery.     In late 2013, Tröegs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tröegs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tröegs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works.     The Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tröegs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others.     Tröegs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tröegs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.    Our state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews.

As Graduation grew near and the cold reality of post-collegiate life set in Luke and Ryan knew that they could turn their affinity for beer and their new found ability to make it into a viable alternative to unemployment or sitting at a desk answering to ""The Man"". Of course, they couldn't do it by themselves, so after very little convincing, they got roommate and friends, Mark Sinclair and Will Rafferty to join them.    On Father's Day in 1999, after almost two years of planning and preperation, the first batch of Hurricane Amber Ale was brewed.

HZvqhd,Starr Hill Brewery,"In the mid-90’s, Master Brewer Mark Thompson returned to his native Virginia from Portland, OR, having learned two things: first, that the craft of artisanal brewing was one part science and one part art; and second, that making delicious beer was a lot cooler than anything he had ever done as a biology student. After several years of apprenticing with other master brewers, Mark was ready to begin crafting beer using his own recipes.    He found the perfect spot in Charlottesville, VA; a historic storefront on Main Street that was once home to the state of Virginia’s first craft brewing operation. In September 1999, Mark re-opened the doors and introduced the Starr Hill Brewery. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its historic building with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall, and it was there that Mark's delicious craft beers became a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world. Nineteen prestigious awards later, Mark’s brews continue to be a hit at beer and music festivals nationwide.    In 2005, in response to the growing demand, Mark moved from this small brewing operation to a larger brewing facility several miles outside of town, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's core and seasonal brews are now enjoyed in restaurants and music clubs throughout the Mid Atlantic and Southeast, and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores in the region.    Mark is proud of the awards his microbrews have earned, and the experts agree that he is among the best craft brewers in the country. But at the end of the day, what still matters most to Mark and his team of brewers at Starr Hill is giving people the gift of great beer.",http://www.starrhill.com/,1999,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4TuN55/upload_zLn8EZ-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4TuN55/upload_zLn8EZ-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4TuN55/upload_zLn8EZ-large.png,5391 Three Notch'D Road,Crozet,Virginia,22932,38.0692617,-78.6866452,434-823-5671,,Y,N,N,Y,tasting,Tasting Room,US,United States,USA,1999,

Tim's background in brewing started in his college days at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. In early 1993, his roommate at the time introduced him to the art of making beer. This smalltime hobby of making beer in a tiny apartment blossomed into a fulltime career, brewing commercially. Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern California to study Fermentation Science. Upon returning to Salt Lake, he aligned himself with a startup brewery called Uinta Brewing Company. The concept for this startup was to brew the freshest beer available in the State of Utah while limiting the alcohol percentage to 3.2 by weight (4% by volume).

NkKRig,Pig's Eye Brewing Company,"Pig's Eye Brewing Company was established in 2002.  The previous owner of the Pig's Eye brands, Minnesota Brewing Company, had gone out of business in June of that year.  We (two former Minnesota Brewing Company employees - Phil Gagne', the Brewmaster, and Jeff Crawford, the VP of Sales) formed Pig's Eye Brewing Company, and purchased the Pig's Eye brands from ... Minnesota Brewing company's creditors in September 2002.     With the old brewery closed, and  limited resources at our disposal, we applied for, and received, permission from the Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau to brew as an ""alternating proprietor"" at City Brewing Company - La Crosse, WI; a brewery with a longstanding brewing heritage, and a commitment to quality.  As an ""alternating proprietor"", we are a ""brewery within a brewery"", essentially renting brewing and packaging equipment from City whenever we are brewing and packaging our products.    Our inaugural brews of Pig's Eye Pilsner and Pig's Eye Light were started on February 18, 2003, with the 1st product run was on March 25, 2003.  To the chagrin of some of our loyal customers, we made the decision to drop the ""Pirate"" rendering of ""Pig's Eye"" from our packaging, in favor of a historically accurate portrayal of Pierre ""Pig's Eye"" Parrant.  In May 2004, in response to consumer interest in low-carb products, we replaced Pig's Eye Light with Pig's Eye Lean Light (the original Pig's Eye light beer).  Our product line expanded again in January 2006 - with the introduction of Pit Bull High Gravity Ice Malt Liquor, and again in June 2007 - with the re-introduction of Pig's Eye Ice.  We  also, for a short period of time, operated as an alternating proprietorship and packaged 24/12 Returnable Bottles at Stevens Point Brewery- Stevens Point, WI, but had to discontinue the production of the returnable bottle package due to increases in packaging costs.     We started out in 2002 as a 2 man owner/operator brewer, and remain so to this day.

After months of cleaning and rebuilding, Keegan Ales brewed its first batch of beers on August 1, 2003(Tommy’s mom’s birthday) and set out hand-selling beer to local bars and restaurants early September. The first kegs of Old Capital, Hurricane Kitty and Mother’s Milk went to competition at Hunter Mountain that month. Mother’s Milk took home a gold medal and Old Capital was honored with People’s Choice: Best of Show.    After getting the brewery up and running selling draft beer, the crew at Keegan Ales turned their attention to the defunct bottling line. It had been left broken and literally in hundreds of pieces.

The youngest of six in a family of caterers, he may have it in his genes to provide others with food and drink, and the early experiments proved a hit at weekly parties on Missoula's University Avenue.

vbKhpV,Redstone Meadery,"David Myers, known as 'Chairman of the Mead', founder of Redstone Meadery, is a romantic and wants to see mead once again enjoying the glory days of yesteryear. He started the Boulder, Colorado company with the 'natural philosophy' that he produce the highest quality honey wine on the market.    Because of this 'philosophy of mead', Redstone does not cork (to avoid oxidation) but instead uses swing top bottles. This ensures the mead will not breathe while cellaring plus offers a much longer shelf life once the bottle has been opened.    In keeping with the 'natural' approach, Redstone does not add any sulfites, a known allergen, as honey is it's own natural preservative. Redstone only pasteurizes the must (unfermented mead) and never boils. The company strives to feature the flavors of the fermentable as much as possible.    In 2003 Redstone Meadery brought the International Mead Festival (www.meadfest.com) to Boulder, Colorado and with that helped to establish mead as its own beverage category. Also at this time Redstone spearheaded the creation of the International Mead Association (www.meadfest.org) to help promote and educate the masses about the world's first fermented beverage.    Currently, Redstone products are distributed to 20 states across the U.S., making it the widest distributed wine from the state of Colorado and one of the most widely distributed meads in the country!

Well, a couple of hoodlums in their late-twenties jumped on the opportunity to own and operate their own brewery, and what resulted is the Iron Horse Brewery you know and love today. They tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good things started to happen.

KzHweV,Ninkasi Brewing Company,"In late 2005, Nikos Ridge and Jamie Floyd met at a favorite local bottle  shop in Eugene, Ore. Nikos was sampling a beer Jamie had brewed at a local  restaurant/brewery and through mutual friends, the two started talking.  The conversation landed on the question, “What would you do if you could  open your own brewery?” With Nikos’ background in finance and Jamie’s  experience in brewing, it seemed like a good skillset for starting a brewery.  The two began brewing about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when  Nikos and Jamie spent 17 hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination  IPA. The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German  restaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped  with a 15-barrel brew house. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one  soul driving purpose—through the creation of the highest quality beers;  to improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its  employees, and business partners.    Both founders knew they wanted to do things differently—within the beer  industry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape  was home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company  that represented what beer meant to them—a source of community and  the root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi—the Sumerian goddess of  fermentation—was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer  not only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but  was also the center of community and culture, one never in operation  without the other—a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to  find property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real  estate in Eugene’s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its  current location in 2007.  Since then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to produce more  beer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility,  tasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the  focus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi’s culture continues to embody  “Believe in the Goddess”—symbolizing the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated  human experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer.  The current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system, with a capacity of  95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska,  California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.  The Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series, has grown from  its first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA,  Believer Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout,  and Quantum Pale Ale. Today, the Ninkasi family of brands includes its  Flagship, Seasonal Release, Special Release, Prismatic Lager, Single Hop,  and R&D Series.",http://www.ninkasibrewing.com/,2006,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-large.png,272 Van Buren St,Eugene,Oregon,97402,44.056855,-123.10988,877-7-NINKASI,,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2006,

It would take 21 years for that initial interest to manifest itself into something drinkable. The spark would come after 9/11 while he drank homebrewed stout with five of his friends. Motivated by patriotic feelings and the American dream of creating a business, the energy was set in motion to start Twin Lakes Brewing Company. Weeks later, Sam and his longtime friends Matt Day, Jack Wick, and Mark Fesche developed a unique 15 gallon gravity fed pilot system and began working to create their first signature brews.    They decided to locate the brewery at the beautiful “Twin Lakes Farm” in Greenville, Delaware. This historic 252 acre farm has been in Sam’s family for seven generations and has a deep rock well aquifer which supplies perfect water for brewing. Local artisans converted an old tractor barn and art studio to accommodate a five vessel, gravity fed brewery and tasting room. Finally, on April 13, 2006, the first two brands, Greenville Pale Ale and Route 52 Pilsner, were launched.     Today Twin Lakes Brewery also produces Tweed’s Tavern Stout, Caesar Rodney Golden Ale and Winterthur Wheat, as well as seasonal styles Oktoberfest and Jublicious.

We craft the finest possible beer in small batches normally not found in the industry today which is typically dominated by mega mergers of international breweries. Is this difficult and more time consuming? Yes. Does it require more manual labor? Yes. Is it worth it? Unequivocally, YES. As beer is a “living, breathing” product made from precise strains of active yeast cultures, it just makes good sense to nurture the product in very manageable small batches. We believe that the extra care and attention devoted to each batch produces the best possible result and you as our friends deserve no less.    We hope that you will have the opportunity to experience the limited quantities of hand crafted beer that we produce in Charlotte. When you do, please notice the complexities of the aroma, the silkiness of its body, and the explosion of flavors as the grains merge artfully with the yeast cultures and noble hops blended meticulously for each variety.

Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).    We took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It’s pretty fun to have someone you don’t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn’t set out to start a business, the business just found us.     “Once in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right” Robert Hunter    We wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners.     Good People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company….to be good people.     In September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together.

XqWTM7,TailGate Beer,"TailGate Beer was founded by a 21-year-old homebrewer, Wesley Keegan. The story goes, Wesley was approached by his father, Tim, one day about what he was going to do with his life. As an ocean lifeguard and co-owner of a bar, Wesley thought he had it made. His dad informed him of a trademark he had won in 2004 and subsequently protected in contest from Anheuser Busch. The name was TailGate Beer.    Tim thought TailGate Beer was something special. As an avid sports fan and tailgater, Tim implored Wesley to take his homebrews that people loved drinking and brew TailGate Beer! Wesley, having put himself through college at San Diego State University, grew up modestly. The gift of TailGate Beer was a generous one but, unlike some tales of entrepreneurism, didn’t come with startup funds.    They both agreed the name was solid and the marketing would one day be fun, but Wesley was emphatic that the beer had to be excellent. From there, Wesley took what he liked to brew, and brewed in Southern California. All initial beers were brewed and packaged in kegs and glass bottles. Wesley entered into the Great American Beer Festival in 2007 and although no formal awards were won, TailGate Beer was a hit! This drew lots of attention from beer fans from all over the country. The common response was “great beer!” and “great name!” So with confirmation of Wesley’s biggest apprehension – people loved the beer – TailGate Beer was born.",http://www.tailgatebeer.com,2007,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PuOZUW/upload_jjOm6o-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PuOZUW/upload_jjOm6o-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PuOZUW/upload_jjOm6o-large.png,,San Diego,California,,32.7153292,-117.1572551,858-215-4842,,Y,N,N,N,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2007,

Its owners, the husband-and-wife team of Peter Ausenhus and Margaret Bishop, have lived near Northwood since their purchase of a nearby farmhouse and acreage in 1998. Nebraska natives, Peter and Margaret lived and worked in Minneapolis for many years before moving to Worth County, where Peter’s grandparents had lived and farmed and where Peter had spent much time as a boy.     Having already established Margaret’s engineering business in downtown Northwood, the couple turned next to Peter’s passion – brewing great beer. For 24 years, Peter has brewed award-winning beer, winning contests, teaching others and perfecting classic recipes along the way. He’s a BJCP National Beer Judge, has brewed professionally with Summit Brewing Company of St. Paul, Minn., and worked on staff at one of the country’s most popular brewing supply shops.    Worth Brewing Company is Peter and Margaret’s way of helping to reintroduce a great tradition – the locally owned brewery serving hand-crafted, high-quality, distinctive beers for the enjoyment of locals and lucky visitors. The nation’s small and mid-sized towns were once dotted with such breweries.

After graduation, Nick got a call from the Harpoon Brewery in Boston and they were willing to give him a shot. While he was working out east, he enjoyed the superb beer culture and variety of beers available in New England. But he knew that he would one day return to Missouri. Finally, after three years, probably too many beers, and the addition of his son, Nick finally got his chance to come back to Missouri. He worked at a small brewpub in Kansas City called The 75th Street Brewery where he was able to experiment with many different beer styles and brewing techniques. Again after a few years, Nick grew restless. While working at a brewpub was fun and enjoyable, it just had too many other distractions from his true passions... Brewing beer, drinking beer and spreading the word about craft beer.  So he started the Doodle Brewing Company with every intention of brewing beers and beer styles that explore the boundries of flavor.

We decided to open Eastern Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael's Winery, and were told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers took home medals in the Maryland Govenor's cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael's Amber ALe) on October 9th.

1irs0u,Greenport Harbor Brewing Company,"The idea began a long time ago over … well … a pretty terrible beer.  You see we (John from NY and Rich from Boston) met in college and had to drink what beer we could afford in those days.    As the years went by, the better the beer we consumed, the more we were consumed by it.  We tried every beer imaginable.  We read about beer. We talked about beer. We began making our own beer.  And finally we started talking and dreaming about opening a brewery on the North Fork.    In the Spring of 2008 the dream became a reality when Rich heard about an old firehouse for sale in the Village of Greenport.  Driven by thirst more than brains, we bought the building in the middle of what has been called a Global Economic Meltdown.  Next we started the renovation.  Did we mention Global Economic Meltdown?  We tried to do most of the work ourselves and luckily got a lot of help from some good friends and family.   The promise of beer can be powerful. Our luck continued when on a snowy January day, with no roof on our brewery, we got a visit from DJ Swanson and his 2 young children. No one in their right mind would have joined us. DJ did and agreed to be our new head brewer. In April with roof replaced, windows installed, and drains dug, our brew house arrived and the idea of making Greenport Harbor beer began. Four months later in July of 2009 we were officially shipping (hand truck and family cars) our beer.    Today our beer is served in over 200 places on Long Island (thank you Justin) and NYC.    We’re proud to say that since summer of 2009 we have been singled out for nearly every beer we have brewed from the Village Voice to the Tasting Table to TimeOut NY to Newsday to NY Examiner to Wall Street Journal to countless beer and food blogs.  We have a total of 13 employees if you include our forklift and delivery truck, which we do.

While your ""good"" nature will definitely be aroused by this cool, spirit-raising refreshment, your inner evil will soon begin to feel less inhibited, allowing initial laughter and fun to soon require an internal battle of self-restraint.    History - Since the dawn of mankind, we have struggled with the battle of good and evil. To drown in guilt or sorrow is unhealthy and seen by some as wasted emotions. In opposition, to live our lives completely without impure influence and to be seen by all as “up-tight” without the ability to cut loose on occasion is viewed in equally a negative fashion. Until now, there has never been a respectable or enjoyable solution to this life long struggle.  HolyBrew is a positive channel for cleansing one’s mind, body and spirit of unwanted or unnecessary guilt, doubt or unhappiness. Through a recently discovered magical formula, believed to be created from the gods themselves, HolyBrew has formulated the “Liquid Confession”. What better way to cleanse one’s soul than to partake of this succulent brew, confess one’s sins and erroneous ways and let the weight of their guilt be lifted and their thirst quenched simultaneously.

lAcrbq,Back Forty Beer Company,"Back Forty is a micro brewery based out of Gadsden, Alabama. With 2 offerings currently distributed throughout the state, Back Forty is the only Alabama based brewery that can be found anywhere from Muscle Shoals to Mobile.    The name Back Forty Beer Company is basically a reference to the back 40 acres of the farm. Tradionally the ""Back 40"" of a farm is the most challenging to maintain, but also produces some of the best yields due to the rich content of the earth. Likewise, Alabama was one of the last States in The Union to update it's outdated beer laws (MS is the only one left), and now it's time to reap those yields.    The craft beer market in Alabama has a lot of room to grow, and we plan on doing everything we can to make that happen. Our main goal is to focus on the local community and support other small business owners while offering up our tasty flavors for the people of Alabama.     The company is founded in Alabama, and just about every aspect of this business is supported by Alabama based suppliers. We've worked with a Design firm out of Athens, AL on our label and logos, our attorney is in Birmingham, our accountant is in Dothan, AL, our shirts are printed in Huntsville and our Brewmaster is out of Montgomery, AL.     We've been working with Jamie Ray (A nationally recognized Brewmaster who has won several medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, CO), for over a year on our first offering, ""Naked Pig Pale Ale"". And we have several ideas in the works for additional year round offerings in the coming months. We're looking forward to producing some great beers that Alabamian's have never tasted before. Once things get up and running, we'll start releasing some seasonal offerings, one-time offerings, limited edition batches, etc. That's what we're really excited about.    The only aspect of this operation that isn't planted firmly in Alabama soil, is the production and packaging. We had to go to another craft brewery in a neighboring state for our first production batches. This is partially due to the enormous start-up costs associated with building a complete brewery operation from scratch. But it's also given us the opportunity to support another regional micro-brewery while we get up and running.",http://www.backfortybeer.com/,2009,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_Lw3eGZ-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_Lw3eGZ-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_Lw3eGZ-large.png,200 North 6th St.,Gadsden,Alabama,35901,34.015484,-86.005585,256-467-4912,,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2009,

QkdgSV,Big Muddy Brewing Co,"All over the United States, craft breweries are continuing an American tradition which experienced an almost 50 year drought after the repeal of prohibition. Big Muddy Brewing in Murphysboro, Illinois is much like many of these new “microbreweries” all over the country, reinvigorating an industry and continuing a heritage that has skipped several generations.  Until 1940, Murphysboro was the home of a thriving brewery and until prohibition; it was one of the cornerstones of the town’s industry. In 1910, the Stecher Brewing Company produced more than 40,000 barrels of beer a year. However, passage of the Volstead Act in 1919, which ushered in the era of prohibition, began a slow decline to the brewery’s demise.  Big Muddy Brewing’s founder Chuck Stuhrenberg attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale in the 1980s. After graduation, he opened a franchise of Chicago’s Rosati’s Pizza in Carbondale and in 1990, began another venture, Spray Shield Industries.  It was while Stuhrenberg was in college at SIU that he began making his own beer.  Stuhrenberg and his college buddies would homebrew, and as the years went on, he began to take his hobby more seriously.  Stuhrenberg always had professional brewing in the back of his mind, but it stayed a hobby until 2009. In July, 2009, Big Muddy Brewing finally began production, the first brewery in Murphysboro in over 50 years.  The first beer offered by Big Muddy Brewing is Kinkaid Wheat. It was a recipe popular with Stuhrenberg’s family and friends. It was also something he felt would be a good “craft beer transition brew” for those used to the conventional corporate brew (BMC).  Kinkaid Wheat is currently offered on tap and by bottle in bars, restaurants and liquor stores across Southern Illinois alongside of Big Muddy Brewing’s second selection, “Saluki Dunkel Dog”, a dark, amber/dunkel style beer.  The third and newest addition to Big Muddy Brewing’s lineup is an ale called “Big Muddy Pale Ale”, and future varieties include “Logan’s Lager”.",http://www.bigmuddybrewing.com/,2009,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_5b1YpK-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_5b1YpK-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_5b1YpK-large.png,1430 North 7th Street,Murphysboro,Illinois,62966,37.7823381,-89.3321145,(618) 684-8833,Sat: 11:00 am - 3:00 pm  `,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2009,

We selected our location nestled in the heart of the beautiful Finger Lakes Region of upstate New York for its close proximity to Keuka Lake and the availability for lake water for brewing. Our building offered a spacious workable layout, ample parking and room for future expansion. We began our building renovations and equipment installation in early 2010,  received our license in the fall of 2010, and on November 11th, 2010 opened our doors for tours, tastings, and growler fills.

basAdv,Funkwerks,"In 2007 Gordon Schuck’s recipe design and brewing skills resulted in a gold medal-winning Saison at the National Homebrew Competition. Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.     Saisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.     Funkwerks’ two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.     Funkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm.

1xeovq,Lucid Brewing,"In July 2010, over a craft beer at a local restaurant, Eric Biermann and Jon Messier had a Lucid thought – “Let’s throw away the ties and the corporate ladders.  Let’s start a craft beer brewery!”  That Clarity in Thinking, led to the successful launch of Lucid Brewing.    In June of 2011, with a year of planning already completed, they realized jumping headfirst into the brewery was the only way they could make their dream a reality.  They quit their day jobs.      With that leap of faith – and a ton of support from many friends and family – they started building their brewery from the ground up.  Through the sweltering heat of the 2011 summer, many friends labored side by side with Jon and Eric.  They did it all, start to finish, from digging trenches to assembling the last tank.  So of course they needed a refreshing and light drink to quench their thirst while they toiled away.  They found just the right recipe and brewed their first beer – AIR.  A beer made to get the job done.  Its slight citrus aroma and flavor, lower ABV and crisp dry finish made this their favorite “go to” beer.      By October the brewery was complete and cooking.  And in the spirit of the season, Eric and Jon gave thanks to the Brew gods when they made their first deliveries to their first three customers the week of Thanksgiving… in Jon’s car.  Lucid was on its way!    Always keeping an eye on the demand for high quality while quickly catching the craft beer lover’s attention, Lucid assembled a team of dedicated employees and introduced brews to quench their customers’ demands.   AIR, DYNO, FOTO and DUO, along with seasonal and small-batch brews, are quickly becoming Minnesota favorites at local bars and restaurants.

Our beer is an output of a thoughtful creative process and we view what we do as art, not commodity. We experiment with new things, but try to predict the outcome in advance. Every so often, we accidentally stumble upon greatness.    Why do we want to brew beer? To satisfy a longing for the simple pleasures and a simpler time. Happiness, joy, and relaxation is our goal.    How are we different from every other craft brewer? The very same thing that makes us the same. We are creative, innovative and different.

While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.     The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.

Decades of drinking beer – and specifically micro-brews – have contributed to Tom’s brewing pedigree. (Or so he says.)

yqQtUG,Brewery & Restaurant,"If you could be doing whatever you want right now, what would you be doing? For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be ""listening to live music and drinking craft beer."" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.     There was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.     It was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.      Everyday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running ""off the grid"" as well.     Ken, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.

YKa9wh,Equinox Brewing Company,"The most common question we get is, why Equinox Brewing? The equinox, and the intrigue of equal night and day, has deep roots in history and ritual. But, at the same time, the equinox marks the changing of the season, and forces us to look toward the future. We find it interesting that the two days out of the year that have perfect light and dark balance also show the balance between the past and the future, tradition and innovation. Beer contains similar elements. Sure, there’s the balance of flavors in a beer; sweet and bitter, rich and simple…    We find another aspect of beer’s balancing act fascinating. Historically, beer styles have developed because of limitations in local ingredients and the necessity to make do with what you have. However, due to global trade and modern shipping methods, limitations on ingredients have been removed. We can get any ingredients we want. While most modern brewers recognize the importance of beer styles and learn from the brewers who made them, they certainly don’t limit themselves to making beers that fit into traditional definitions.    On one level our beers fit into some traditional styles, but we put our own twist on them. We want our beers to capture elements from the past and incorporate new ideas, ingredients and techniques into them. We’re not afraid to try new things.

Building permits were finally obtained and brewery construction began in October 2009. Federal and state brewery licenses applications were submitted March 1, 2010 and approved by July 2010.

4V6C7Y,Yellowhammer Brewery,"Launched in late 2010 in downtown Huntsville, Yellowhammer Brewing seeks to bring Belgian and German tradition to Alabama. That means Euopean styles, but with a slight Southern interpretation.  Thanks to Free the Hops and the change in Alabama's formerly restrictive beer laws, creativity in brewing has come to Alabama.    At Yellowhammer, head brewer Keith Yager draws inspiration from both Belgian and German brewing traditions. An accomplished home brewer since 1995, Yager has designed numerous seasonal and specialty batches, from the Dark Hammer Belgian Quad to the UberAlt sticke ale. Other recurring ales are more experimental, blending styles, as with Tobacco Road, an imperial amber designed to complement a good cigar, or the occasional Lonesome Hop series, which spotlights the character of an individual hop. Yellowhammer is Yager's first commercial undertaking.    Yellowhammer Brewing opened on Oct. 16, 2010 with the best-selling Belgian white ale and the IPA. Other staples sold throughout the year include a German style altbier and the Miracle Worker, a potent Belgian tripel.",http://www.yellowhammerbrewery.com/,2010,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BI8mE7/upload_h0FCyk-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BI8mE7/upload_h0FCyk-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BI8mE7/upload_h0FCyk-large.png,2406 Clinton Avenue,West Huntsville,Alabama,35805,34.722525,-86.603703,256-975-5950,,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2010,

G5N8qx,14th Star Brewing,"History books tell us that local Vermonter and beer enthusiast Ethan Allen was a leader inthe effort to make Vermont the fourteenth star on the U.S. flag in 1791. And those textbooks are right; especially about the 1791 part.    Today, in Franklin County, Vermont, Army veteran Steve Gagner is honoring his home state and passion – brewing great beer – with 14th Star Brewing Co.    14th Star is Steve’s 1,200-square-foot nanobrewery on Lower Newton Street, in St. Albans City.    Nanobreweries make less than four-barrel batches, and as of your eyes hitting this paragraph, there are still less than 100 nanobreweries in America.    What makes 14th Star stand out? Well, it’s about the only brewery in Vermont that’s located above Burlington. Period.    But that’s not it. Not entirely.    You see – this is your beer. Oh, sure, Steve plans on starting you off with one-barrel batches of pale ale, brown ale, and Belgian white. There will be more, of course, but that’s up to you. So tell Steve what style beer you want in your 14th Star growler at: steve@14thstarbrewing.com.  On our end, we are readying to open our doors. Our goal is this July.

We take wine seriously and feature farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.    Central to Bull City Burger and Brewery’s core values is sustainability; our attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.",http://www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com/,2011,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_8LAKzQ-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_8LAKzQ-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_8LAKzQ-large.png,107 East Parrish Street,Durham,North Carolina,27701,35.995445,-78.899939,919-680-2333,Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm  Friday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish  Closed Sundays,Y,N,N,Y,brewpub,Brewpub,US,United States,USA,2011,
dB9k9t,Burley Oak Craft Brewery,"Hi there! We have been hard at work building this brewery keeping in mind sustainable practices and using local materials and craftsmen. We love our town of Berlin, Maryland and hope you join us in our taproom for a couple of pints and growlers. Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.    Why ""Burley Oak?""    The inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse.     Berlin, Maryland in Wikipedia   The town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of ""Burleigh Inn"", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).    It just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.",http://www.burleyoak.com/,2011,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rKXfsB/upload_ogqSYh-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rKXfsB/upload_ogqSYh-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rKXfsB/upload_ogqSYh-large.png,10016 Old Ocean City Blvd,Berlin,Maryland,21811,38.3338561,-75.2169099,410-422-8887,"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm   Thursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am  Sunday 12pm - 9pm",Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2011,

qUIYuC,Lucky Town Brewing Company,"Living in Mississippi, the selection of beer has always been limited compared to the rest of the country – but that does not stop those of us who seek out the diverse supply of the world’s greatest beers. Some drive across state lines to acquire the finer choices at festivals and suppliers alike, while others exchange trades with those from other states in search of the locally forbidden. But for those who truly take matters into their own hands, homebrewing beer becomes the purest form of gratification.    Driven by an extreme passion for both innovation and beer, our Brewmaster took what was once just a dream and decided to create a beer that would not only break state laws but also help change the very same laws that Mississippi has let fall behind. For eight years, he brewed beers of many different styles as a hobby - and with each tasting that he would hold at his home, the crowds grew larger. Eventually, he would be convinced that this beer should be available to those patrons who also appreciate the finer beers of the world.    Lucky Town Brewing Company was founded on this very notion – to craft beers that break boundaries between the working men and women of Mississippi and their wish for locally produced premium beer.

I4hZZy,Odyssey Beerwerks,"Back when the world was a much different place, filled with grunge music, loose fitting clothes, and Wayne’s World movies, two shady characters fell in together and started doing various sketch and wonderful things. One of these was brewing . . . beer. Not the tasty, modern, complex craft beers flowing in today’s market, but the goofy and “just OK” beers that home brewers in the 90’s seemed to know how to build. These guys (we’ll call them Chris and Josh for lack of anonymity’s sake) got better at brewing over the years, even as they moved apart.    Chris went down a corporate marketing path; Josh seemed to prefer engineering and operations; both still enjoyed beer and, with lots of practice, the homebrew got better and better. When Y2K sputtered out before it even came to life, the two had their first discussion about opening a brewery. More life happened. More of the guys’ improving craft beers were served at more home parties. When they got together again more recently, the topic resurfaced, but this time it wouldn’t go away. And gradually a brewery was born.    20 years since the start of their homebrew hobbies, Odyssey Beerwerks was formed to do the impossible: take an enjoyable hobby of creating fine craft beers and make it into a dreary job, with the benefit of bringing new and exciting hand crafted beers onto our vibrant planet.",http://www.odysseybeerwerks.com/,2011,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zMORP4/upload_73PUUD-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zMORP4/upload_73PUUD-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zMORP4/upload_73PUUD-large.png,"5535 W 56th Ave,",Arvada,Colorado,80002,39.8007911,-105.0589359,(303) 421-0772,M-Th 3-9  F-Sa 2-10  Su Noon-7,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2011,

We were a bit surprised and overwhelmed by the seriousness of this beer-brewing business.  I thought, “Oh great, there’s more storage space gone once Adam gives up on this little hobby in a month’s time.”  Even though I rarely admit to being wrong now that we’re married, I couldn’t have been farther from the mark thinking that this would be an easily discarded hobby.  The first brewing system has been dwarfed by the upgraded and supersized brewhouse, and there has been no chance for the mash tun, brew kettle, or hot liquor tank to gather any dust!

We are a small brewery, and are truly “hands on” every step of the brewing process.  Our goal is to produce the best, most flavorful, most memorable local beers possible.  We think we’ve met that goal, & hope you’ll agree.    At Aftershock, we believe there are two different approaches to brewing.  The most common approach used by the major breweries is a ‘scientific one’.  All stages of the brewing process are closely monitored to ensure a consistent, if tasteless product.  Computers and other high tech equipment are more in control than the brewer himself.  With this approach you get ‘scientific’ beer.  The other approach is a more artistic one, while still respecting basic laws of science, and the need for spotless cleanliness.  That’s the approach we plan to always take at Aftershock.  At the risk of losing an undetectable amount of consistency, the result is beer with much more character, subtle nuances, and awesome flavor.

VE4Gms,Amplified Ale Works,"Alex Pierson and JC Hill got their noses in the restaurant business in 2009, opening the first California Kebab at San Diego State University. After a few years, it was clear they needed to spread the kebab love elsewhere, and decided on a run down old resturant site with an ocean view..    Craft beer has been a part of the concept since day 1, and JC's severe homebrewing addiction ignited the need for their own brewing system at the new establishment - Amplified Ale Works was born. Why Amplified you ask? Two parts – one, our obsession with live music (a band was formed between CK staff in 2009, playing in JC’s garage ever since), and two, our take on the meaning of Amplified- to us, it means intensifying the craft beer experience by staying true to our homebrewing roots.

Back East brews several different styles of high-quality ales and lagers and distributed on draft and in 64 oz growlers and 750 ml bottles at fine establishments throughout the Greater Hartford area.

He eventually moved Back East to Connecticut in 2000, with the dream of someday operating a Craft brewery. As a Professional Engineer, Edward enjoys the technical aspects of brewing. Tony developed his appreciation for Craft beer during his college years in Vermont, and always imagined launching a brewery. An entrepreneur at heart and a CPA with extensive experience in accounting, auditing, and insurance, Tony loves building a successful business from the ground up. Tony and Edward began homebrewing and experimenting with different recipes in early 2006, and immersed themselves in all things Craft beer.

As you turn off Ramada Drive and onto Marquita Way, you will meander around a majestic oak tree.  This majestic white oak stands in the middle of where the road would have gone, if not for this tree’s historical significance.  If you look closely at the trunk of this old oak, you will notice the mark of an equal armed cross carved into its bark. The cross was carved sometime between 1775 and 1776 when Spanish Lt. Colonel Juan Batista de Anza led more than 240 men, women and children on an overland journey from the frontier New Spain to settle in Alta California. During that 1,200 mile journey, the very thirsty Colonel carved the cross to signify the perfect location for a brewery…well, that’s our story at Barrelhouse and we can’t exactly prove it, but we’re sticking to it!  Historians believe that Juan Batista de Anza or someone on his team carved the cross to indicate a safe place to camp.  We think it makes a sweet logo, too!    After you pass the old oak, make a left on Limestone Way and look for the dragon fly…you can’t miss it.     Stop by, grab a brew or two and relax.  Enjoy our glorious beer gardens with friends while you listen to the waterfall and experience the central coast the way it was meant to be enjoyed…outside.

ktgW91,Brevard Brewing Co.,"The world of beer is increasingly one of two extremes.  While large macro-breweries compete to produce the lightest, most flavorless, adjunct laden beers possible, craft breweries strive to out-do one another by making each beer hoppier, bolder, and stronger than the next.  At Brevard Brewing Company, we have set out to give beer lovers the best of both worlds – beer that is both drinkable and flavorful.  We are the only brewery in Western North Carolina to specialize in lagers.     What’s the big deal about lagers? Lagers are cold-fermented and aged over twice as long as ales.  They are more costly to produce, and take more patience to brew. Unlike the big flavors of ales that hide imperfections, lagers demand a higher standard of quality and care, making them a rare find in the craft beer world.  But the result is worth the attention to detail--this painstaking process creates a beer that is clean, smooth, and crisp as opposed to the bold, complex flavor of ales.  The imported German barley, hops, and yeast delivers delicate and refined beers that are delicious and flavorful, yet supremely drinkable.    While German-inspired lagers are my specialty, I will never forget the wonderful contributions that American home brewers have made to the beer world over the past thirty years.  I typically find myself drinking a cold, smooth, Pilsner, but every now and again, my taste buds crave a bold, hoppy American IPA.  This is why Brevard Brewing Company offers American ales in addition to German lagers.  No matter your mood or what you are craving, we have the right beer for you.",http://www.brevard-brewing.com/,2012,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/enoxkn/upload_H1vHPy-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/enoxkn/upload_H1vHPy-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/enoxkn/upload_H1vHPy-large.png,63 East Main Street,Brevard,North Carolina,28712,35.2333243,-82.7333116,,Mon:  4:00pm - 10:00pm Tue:  4:00pm - 10:00pm Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm Thu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm Fri:  2:00pm - 12:00am Sat:  2:00pm - 12:00am Sun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm  Monday-Thursday:  4:00pm - 10:00pm  Friday & Saturday: 2:00pm - 12:00am  Sunday: 2:00pm - 9:00pm,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2012,

Rickoli’s respects the liquid in the glass and wants to help elevate beer to a refined drinking experience. That’s why we use the finest ingredients and brew in a leisurely manner. The beer tells us when it’s ready. We refuse to be a slave to production deadlines.  Wheat Ridge Colorado is a relaxed community just west of Denver with easy access from I-70. Wheat Ridge was one of the few remaining enclaves along the Front Range without a microbrewery. This changed in November 2012!  We are dedicated to providing our local neighborhood with a place to relax and have a pint close to home.    Our Brew master, Rick Abitbol has been professionally brewing award winning beers along the Front Range for over a decade.  Rick is respectful of beer styles and traditional brewing technique.  And has long been an innovator of style and not afraid to color outside the lines. He was one of the first brewers to explore the Black IPA which has since come to be regarded as a new style in judging guidelines.   We love hops! That’s not to say you won’t find any wonderfully malty creations on tap there are many, but what you will notice is the variety in our hoppy selections.  Be on the lookout for Rick’s special brews!    We’re Talking Much Better Beer!  We are pleased to feature a great selection of Gluten Reduced Beer.  All Rickoli’s brews that do not contain wheat are considered gluten reduced.  Making great craft beer more accessible to everyone.

The two made many friends spending spare evenings in New England pubs offering European beers, which, before the emergence of American craft beers, were the best beers available. The two often discussed their dream of opening their own brewery over the years. In August of 2012, John and Dan decided to take the keg into their own hands, and ENKI Brewing Company was born. Just a few months later, their dreams came to fruition at 7929 Victoria Drive.

With a focus on premium quality, handmade Ales and Lagers, FDBC will present a new unique product to the Detroit area.    Made in Michigan and the U.S.A.    One of the missions of FDBC is to create jobs and spur the economy in Michigan and the U.S. in general. At opening we plan to have 18 positions available with that number doubling year to year. Our long term goal is a bottling factory and additional restaurants that will employee hundreds of local workers.    Keeping with our philosophy of locally sourced goods and services, we will purchase from local companies whenever possible. On the food side this includes local fish markets, meat markets and bakeries; and on the brewery side designing beers that will be made using Michigan grown hops and malt. And it doesn’t stop there! We are actively negotiating and designing the brew house, promotional materials, general construction and website operations with Michigan companies.    Where it is not possible to source a product or service locally or in the State of Michigan, we will be looking first to keep our business in the Mid-West and then United States. We call this an inside-out sourcing philosophy. First source at the city level and slowly work out by county, state, region and country. We feel this benefits everyone in this endeavor where we support the community that is supporting us. A Win-Win for everyone!    It’s All About the Beer!    We are going to be creating quality; handcrafted beers that we believe will be some of the best beer you have ever tried.

Well, for us, there's a lot of anticipation in tasting a new beer. The way the foam settles in a glass of dark stout, or the raining effect you can see in a pint of IPA served on nitro... they remind us sometimes of the expectant feeling we get watching powerful storms roll in over the mountains in our home town of Colorado Springs. Yes, we tend to wax poetic over a pint glass. I told you we love beer. But anyway, that was part of the inspiration. The other part was our beloved half Husky, half Aussie brewdog, Storm. He's a little... wild. Like our beers.      We hope you'll find the same passion for drinking our beers as we do for making them. Come in and see us, we'll be pleased to pour you a pint.

Kauai Island Brewing Company (KIBC) has its origins in Waimea Brewing Company, which had been located on the historic Waimea Plantations. When the lease was up, owners Bret and Janice Larson, along with their brewmaster Dave Curry and his wife Christina, decided to come together and become co-owners of their newly created Kauai Island Brewing Company, moving locations to Port Allen where they would have more space to brew the delicious beers they were known for.     After eight months of renovation, Kauai Island Brewing Company has its home in the industrial building complex of Port Allen Center, with an industrial theme to go along with both its surroundings and purpose of crafting quality beers. Its 35-foot high corrugated metal ceilings and walls give it an open and spacious feel.

Xz6lr3,Our Mutual Friend Malt & Brew,"Our Mutual Friend is a brewery and taproom located in the Five Points neighborhood of Denver. For us, brewing beer began as an excuse to gather with our friends and ruminate on life, philosophy, music, food, and of course, beer. Once we got started, we grew more curious about the brewing process, honing our craft and experimenting with different methods and techniques. Along the way a fundamental question to our process was, how can we do more of this ourselves? Our desire to participate in every step of the grain to glass process led us to open Our Mutual Friend.    At OMF, our goal is to use local sources to brew local ales. This is why we malt and roast as much of the grain we use in our beer as we can. As a small maltstery, we have more influence over the quality and freshness of the beers we pour in our taproom, and more opportunities to source our ingredients locally. 100 percent of our barley is grown right here in Colorado. And as much as possible, we source our hops and specialty ingredients from farms in our state.     Part of what we love about beer is its power to bring people together (hence our name!). We’re excited to be a gathering place in the Five Points neighborhood where locals and visitors alike can meet in camaraderie alongside a quality pint of ale. We believe in the power of neighborly acts and the spirit of neighbors taking care of one another within the local community. We at OMF support and strive for the Denver community to know each other better and enjoy a good pint in the same process.     We are excited to see our city developing a local, world-class brewery community, and look forward to building relationships with our friends and neighbors, and collaborating with other breweries to cherish our Denver home and protect our collective local influence.",http://www.omfmb.com/,2012,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Ij1ASf/upload_nGDJ35-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Ij1ASf/upload_nGDJ35-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Ij1ASf/upload_nGDJ35-large.png,2810 Larimer Street,Denver,Colorado,80205,39.760595,-104.982712,(720) 722-2810,Thu: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm  Fri: 4:00 pm - 12:00 am  Sat: 2:00 pm - 12:00 am  Sun: 2:00 pm - 10:00 pm,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2012,
A6u3vC,Brewery & Pub,"We are a very small-scale brewery and pub specializing in foreign and unique beers and eats.  Our brewery is a 1 barrel system (two kegs) which we use to create hand-crafted, more often than not, specialty ales.  Our brewery is based around experimentation, so our taps change frequently.  We usually do not brew the same beer twice, but will do so if enough people ask.    By definition, an outlander is a stranger, a foreigner, but here he is much more. This is how we see him: The outlander is the innovator; he is the one who drives change. It is the outlander, whether in mind or origin, who represents the ambitious, passionate pioneer who is willing to put everything on the line in order to make his dream come true. It’s often a simple dream, a dream to share his knowledge, his expertise with the ones who call him stranger. And certainly the public may reject his ideas, they may cast him back to where he came from. But does this ever worry the outlander? Never. Because the outlander believes in his ideas. He knows what he is offering is great and he knows others, once they put aside their prejudice, will know this too. He knows that someone who has invested their time, their life, their hopes and dreams behind something cannot fail.

We take our beer and food seriously and we hope to politely challenge people’s perspective of how beer can be paired with food.

90gAzo,Wicked Weed Brewing Company,"In 2009 Walt and Luke sat at a craft beer bar and talked about the dream of opening their own brewery that would focus on big West Coast hoppy ales and authentic Belgain ales that would inspire those who drank them. From that conversation forward there would be no looking back. A business plan was developed and hundreds of test batches brewed. In 2011 Walt and Luke’s lifelong friend Ryan Guthy and his parents Rick and Denise all sat down at their house in the mountains of Western North Carolina to taste some of Luke and Walt’s creations while looking over the plans for what would be Wicked Weed Brewing.  After being thoroughly impressed with the full flavor and vision of the project, the Guthys joined the Dickinsons and the team was assembled.  Over the next months Wicked Weed Brewing found a home at 91 Biltmore avenue, a building that seemed destined to be a brewery.  With the creativity of Luke, vision of Walt, dedication of Ryan, exquisite taste of Denise and wisdom of Rick a truly unique brewery was born.  So from the humble beginning of a basement, the dream of Wicked Weed Brewing has come to life. Our beer is bold, full of excitement and flavor.  Always focused on drinkability and pushing the boundaries of what we think we are capable of.  Wicked Weed Brewing will always evolve, always grow and always aspire to be greater.

YbkkwZ,Wildcard Brewing Company,"Wildcard Brewing Company was just a dream until experience, encouragement and circumstance made it a reality. The idea behind the name Wildcard is to pursue the unknown. Wildcard Brewing Company’s owners left stability for chaos, moved to England to learn the craft of beer making, and started a business in an uncertain economy, all in pursuit of a dream. You’d call them crazy, adventurous, unpredictable....a wildcard. Our story is one of the unexpected; a place where there are no limits, where perseverance and a free spirit will turn dreams into reality.     It started when Jeff and Jenny brewed two beers to give away as wedding favors at a brewery in San Luis Obispo where they went to college. Homebrew projects and burst bottle explosions ensued in the years after. But a casual passion soon turned career as Jeff and Jenny headed to England. Jeff studied brewing science at the University of Sunderland and Jenny conducted “research” in various local pubs. Once back in the states Jeff headed straight for the most competitive brewing location, the Pacific Northwest. Now 4 years later the pair are back in Jeff’s hometown of Redding building out their production brewery.    Wildcard is small startup business focused on brewing flavorful beers and enriching the communities that enjoy them. Spending dollars locally is just a part of that commitment. We will source products and services within 500 miles of our facility as much as possible and intend to exclusively sell beers within that same area. Supporting local businesses not only has great economic impacts but environmental as well. We don’t want to just do business in the Redding community we want to be a part of it. It is important to give back as much as possible to the community and we will make it a point to donate and get involved in local causes and efforts.",http://www.wildcardbrewingco.com/,2012,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TD4EGg/upload_DQdvya-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TD4EGg/upload_DQdvya-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TD4EGg/upload_DQdvya-large.png,9565 Crossroads Dr,Redding,California,96003,40.565865,-122.297279,(530) 722-9239,Wed - Thu: 2:00 pm - 8:00 pm  Fri - Sat: 12:00 pm - 9:00 pm  Sun: 12:00 pm - 5:00 pm,Y,N,N,Y,nano,Nano Brewery,US,United States,USA,2012,

Through the integration of sustainable production methods, environmentally conscious waste management and innovative water recycling/reclamation techniques, we hope to become a model for breweries and agricultural destinations throughout the nation.    The BrewhouseThe brew house is an engineered mix of new and old technologies and techniques. Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.    The prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not. The beer is unfiltered, its clarity being attained by the addition of natural clarifying agents and allowing ample time for the beer to condition.

CPYUBy,Jack Pine Brewery - Taproom,"Most homebrewers, at some point, begin to dream of starting their own brewery.  I had always liked my beer, but I realized that there tends to be a brewer’s bias towards their own beer.  A great deal of time and effort goes into making a batch of beer, so the brewer is bound to speak highly of their own goods.  It turns out, I’m my own worst critic.  I’m constantly searching for ways to improve the beer.  Whenever I shared brews with others, they always liked it as well, but who doesn’t like free beer?  For me, the seed was planted quite a few years ago when I started winning homebrewing awards statewide.  It was then I began to realize that I was making more than just pretty good homebrew.  I was making some damn good beer!  I began volunteering to judge at homebrew competitions and making an effort to get out and sample more of the beers not available in northern Minnesota.  I quickly realized that there was much more to explore in the world of beer than I realized.  I studied and tasted everything I could find regarding brewing science and beer styles.  In the midst of all of the studying and research, I took the Beer Judge Certification Program test and obtained a National rank in the BJCP.  I now had some credentials to back up my knowledge of good beer and brewing.  It was clear that this was starting to become more than just a hobby, so I began to put a bit more time and effort into the dream of starting a brewery.    So, after all this research and planning, what’s the plan?  Start small.    Jack Pine Brewery is starting very small.  Nanobrewery small.  Brewing forty gallons at a time small.  Did I mention the brewer is small?    This little brewery serves as a pilot system for the eventual build-out of a full scale production brewery.  It provides the opportunity to test the waters before sinking a boatload of cash into a warehouse full of stainless equipment.  Best of all, it gives YOU a chance to TRY THE BEER!  I’ve been my own worst critic for the past 12 years of homebrewing.  Now it’s your turn.  With your help, we can build a brewery to provide our friends and neighbors with delicious locally-brewed beer.    So, stop in and give it a try!",http://jackpinebrewery.com/,2012,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_6VMNdS-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_6VMNdS-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_6VMNdS-large.png,"7942 College Rd, Ste 115",Brainerd,Minnesota,56425,46.3447626,-94.2338287,(218) 270-8072,Friday 4-7pm  Saturday 4-7pm,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2013,

2EpPvi,Miner Brewing Company,"Located in the heart of the Black Hills, and owned and operated by the same family behind the award-winning Prairie Berry Winery, Miner Brewing Company produces craft beers that are both traditional in nature, and yet truly “South Dakota”.    With five generations of family lineage handcrafting beverages in South Dakota, and with 15 years as winemaker and owner of Prairie Berry Winery, Brewmaster Sandi Vojta is inspired by the traditional brewing styles of her family’s European heritage. By infusing regional and seasonal ingredients into the recipes handed down to her, she has skillfully adapted those traditional styles to create craft beers with a regional character, setting each distinctly apart from other microbrews.    All of our beers are produced in small, 15-barrel fermenters, allowing us to keep each batch small enough to maintain microbrew quality and a close attention to detail at all times. The results are craft beers that are approachable and distinctive, to be enjoyed by craft beer novices and enthusiasts alike.    We invite you to experience Miner Brewing for yourself, as we open our Tap Room in Hill City this fall 2013.

We look at beer with a kind of childlike wonder. Beer is alchemy, the holiest magic. And even though we take what we do very seriously, we never want to forget how magical it is. The name constantly reminds us of that.    When you glance at our label, it looks classic and refined. Then you take a second look and you realize it's a horse with tiny T-Rex arms.    We wanted the name to have the same effect as the beer. To make you look—and taste—twice.    Also, it's pretty damn unforgettable.    Oh yeah. That guy up there grinnin' like a shot fox?

Once the business was formed, a brewery name was needed.  After weeks of brainstorming, the name ‘Quest’ rose to the top of our list.  We wanted a name that emulates that passionate and adventurous spirit of the Greenville community.    ”People in Greenville are always on some kind of quest.  Whether it is to bike the entire Swamp Rabbit Trail or hike Table Rock, there is a very adventurous spirit here.  We wanted to embrace that.” -Quest’s Andrew Watts    Quest’s beer is meant to be premium and sought-after, much like a goal or quest.

3wVSu9,Timeless Pints Brewing Company,"Lakewood's first microbrewery!     On Father's Day, several years ago, my son and I purchased a home brewing kit for my husband. As an Engineer and a lover of craft beer, he was excited to experiment with his own concoctions. Since his first trial run, he's produced multiple variety of stouts, ales, lagers and IPA's as well as very happy friends, family and neighbors. His love for the unique keeps him constantly in search of ""new and different"" ingredients and the hope of a perfect combination.    One hot July evening, some friends disclosed they were embarking on a new restaurant idea. They asked Chris (my husband) if he would brew the beer specifically for their new endeavor.

CWwxeR,Brüeprint Brewing Company,"The story of Brüeprint Brewing Company begins five years ago in a family kitchen in Holly Springs, North Carolina. It’s in the Wagner kitchen where Eric first combined his passion and talent for gourmet cooking with over 20 years of engineering expertise, specifically in treating water. Who knew that brewing delicious beer was so similar to the science of treating water? The process of releasing enzymes to break down starches into sugar and fermenting the sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide is second nature to a water engineer, while balancing delicious flavor is what a gourmet cook strives for. Hence the “blueprint” for great beer was born! Eric’s unique combination of talents led the way for the one-of-a-kind, handcrafted beer, each as original as a fingerprint.    Better than a recipe, a brewing “blueprint” combines science and great culinary skill to create a Brüeprint.    It’s with this vision that we bring Apex its first handcrafted Brewery—Brüeprint Brewing Company. The Wagner family, that is Brüeprint, is dedicated to traditional social interaction while sampling delicious beer. Our hope is that you’ll rest your phone for a few minutes to have a real conversation, partake in or watch a game with friends, or take in a great band.

06ughl,Tin Whiskers Brewery and Taproom,"The three founders of Tin Whiskers Brewing Co., LLC are George Kellerman, Jake Johnson, and Jeff Moriarty. They first met in 2005 while going to the University of Minnesota for bachelor degrees in Electrical Engineering. Over time, they all worked together as hardware design engineers for a small engineering services company specializing in RF-centric products. Being young engineers working downtown Minneapolis, they attended various happy hours together. It quickly became clear that they all really loved craft beer and were very intrigued with the science of the brewing process.    Jake and Jeff are the two brewers of the company who designed and honed the recipes. They got their start in 2006 brewing extract kits on Jake's Mom's kitchen stove much to her chagrin. (A few boil-overs did occur on her stove, whoops!) They brewed countless extract kits until in 2010, when after touring Surly and Flat Earth, they were inspired to turn their passion (like the founders of those breweries) into a business. From that point forward it has been all grain brewing and loving it. Nowadays, Jake focuses on the brewing aspect of the business while Jeff focuses on the brewing as well as the business side of the operation.    George, in the early years, was a force within the brewery by helping out at every brew session and providing needed muscle for cleaning and moving material around the brewhouse. He focused a lot on the quality of our beer and pushed us to design better more complex beers.

G5N8qx,14th Star Brewing,"History books tell us that local Vermonter and beer enthusiast Ethan Allen was a leader inthe effort to make Vermont the fourteenth star on the U.S. flag in 1791. And those textbooks are right; especially about the 1791 part.    Today, in Franklin County, Vermont, Army veteran Steve Gagner is honoring his home state and passion – brewing great beer – with 14th Star Brewing Co.    14th Star is Steve’s 1,200-square-foot nanobrewery on Lower Newton Street, in St. Albans City.    Nanobreweries make less than four-barrel batches, and as of your eyes hitting this paragraph, there are still less than 100 nanobreweries in America.    What makes 14th Star stand out? Well, it’s about the only brewery in Vermont that’s located above Burlington. Period.    But that’s not it. Not entirely.    You see – this is your beer. Oh, sure, Steve plans on starting you off with one-barrel batches of pale ale, brown ale, and Belgian white. There will be more, of course, but that’s up to you. So tell Steve what style beer you want in your 14th Star growler at: steve@14thstarbrewing.com.  On our end, we are readying to open our doors. Our goal is this July.

The area was “16 miles from anywhere” in the county and was the best place for farmers, merchants, and politicians to meet to conduct official business. Georgetown replaced Lewes as the County Seat when numerous petitions were sent to Delaware’s General Assembly requesting that the move be made to accommodate all county residents.

5R4Akp,3 Sheeps Brewing Company,"All families have their stories: tales of grandparents and great-grandparents and the incredible things they accomplished, or lived through, or overcame. My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.    Back in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.    I grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife’s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.    This is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality.

1mRL8J,350 Brewing Company,"The 350 Brewing Company has spawned from the ashes of our failed Collegiate careers at Northern Illinois University. Let me explain. 350 Augusta Ave. was our address in Dekalb, IL. At the time, your founders Todd and Erik spent more time on projects like way below average punk rock bands in the attic, and a Hardcore Wrestling Federation called WCVF (this took place in our kitchen), instead of focusing on classes like Humanities 227 in DuSable Hall. I mean, have you ever choke slammed one of your best friends into an oven pre-heated to ""550 degrees""? Well i have, and that was just a random Wednesday night. This raw energy (stupidity) and creativity is what eventually drew us to the Craft Beer scene. That’s what craft beer is…a creative and fresh twist on a beverage that has been mass produced and shoved down our throats for much too long (carefully stepping down from soapbox). Why not name our Brewery after the point in our life when we were most creative? Well…..we did. It was during these times we were also introduced to good, quality beer.    Once NIU had enough of our shenanigans, Erik went on to continue his education while I submerged myself into the cesspool known as corporate America. I feel dirty just talking about it. Over the last decade, my soul has been slowly rotting and exiting my body so there was a need for this creative juice to be squeezed once again. Since wrestling and punk rock was now out of the question, brewing beer quickly became that much needed release from the Groundhog Day that had become the norm for us. Erik like most homebrewers started out brewing with extract several years ago and quickly rose to the challenge of all-grain batches. Erik, the 350 Head brewer, has been very successful when entering brewing competitions walking away with multiple awards for his Porter and Patersbier. Myself on the other hand have had a love for flavorful craft beer for many moons, and once I learned of Erik’s brewing expertise years ago, I too became emerged in this brewing lifestyle. It was a match made in heaven. Erik brewed awesome beer, and I was awesome at drinking and sharing that beer!!!     From that point on things just sort of clicked and for the last 2 years Erik and I have been researching and concocting this master plan of opening a brewery. The time has come. We want all of you to enjoy this journey with us. Tinley Park has always been our #1 choice for the 350 Brewing Company. Downtown Tinley Park embodies the spirit of 350. With great electricity in the downtown area, coupled with an amazing artistic feel, will definitely pair well with our vision of always making sure a visit to our brewery is an interesting experience. We feel Tinley Park is ready for a neighborhood brewery. It really was an easy decision based on Tinley Park’s sense of community and passion for supporting local products.    We are looking forward to joining the family of incredible Illinois Brewers. We should all thank our lucky stars that we live in a state with such high quality Breweries.",http://350Brewing.com,2013,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W3pb09/upload_pRw6FS-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W3pb09/upload_pRw6FS-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W3pb09/upload_pRw6FS-large.png,7144 183rd St,Tinley Park,Illinois,60477,41.5593734,-87.7911748,,,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,,

The most common approach used by the major breweries is a ‘scientific one’.  All stages of the brewing process are closely monitored to ensure a consistent, if tasteless product.  Computers and other high tech equipment are more in control than the brewer himself.  With this approach you get ‘scientific’ beer.  The other approach is a more artistic one, while still respecting basic laws of science, and the need for spotless cleanliness.  That’s the approach we plan to always take at Aftershock.

krIs45,Alaskan Brewing Company,"Alaska has a rich history of brewing. From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.    In 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.    Marcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. ""Why not start a brewery?"" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.    Maybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.    While researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.    In December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.",http://www.alaskanbeer.com/,1986,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_32dIr0-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_32dIr0-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VPHkaP/upload_32dIr0-large.png,5429 Shaune Drive,Juneau,Alaska,99801,58.3570171,-134.4893459,907-780-5866,"Mon:  8:00am - 5:00pm Tue:  11:00am - 5:00pm  Business hours:  8 a.m. - 5 p.m., Monday - Friday    Gift shop and tour hours:  Winter Hours: October - April: 11 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., Tuesday - Saturday  Summer Hours: May - September: 11 a.m. - 6 p.m., 7 days a week",Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,1986,

5tw2Iw,Angel City Brewing,"Angel City Brewery is excited to be part of the brewing renaissance of Downtown LA by bringing old-world, small-batch, craft brewing to the new world of the expanding Arts District. We are committed to the continued growth and revitalization of our neighborhood by being an interactive and supportive partner to the arts and business communities, as well as the burgeoning craft beer movement in Los Angeles.    Angel City Brewing was founded in 1997. Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA’s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great city a great brewery.    On January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.    Since January 2012, we’ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.    In February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out. In addition to the neighborhood cuisine, our parking lot has become a hot spot for food trucks, with one parked outside nearly every night we’re open. On May 5th, 2013 we had our grand opening with our first ever Heritage Festival.

He started very small, but is now growing at an unbelieveable pace, thanks to a lot of hard work finally paying off and a lot of prayers being answered.   Says Mike: ""Initially, I decided to make everything from scratch because I couldn't afford to buy whatI needed.  Once I made a 1932 yellow deuce coupe in my garage and it became a beautiful running hot rod.  A buddy of mine told me ""If I could do that, then I could make a brewery come true!""  That really stuck with me.  Little Area 51 Craft Brewery takes a chance in a worldwide market and it was a good choice according to an ever growing popularity.  Why Alien Head Beer? Earthly beers are brewed somewhat similar ways and have a common process.  Alien Head Beer is actually brewed in a special process that is unlike other breweries and delivers a taste that is out of this world!

Tony developed his appreciation for Craft beer during his college years in Vermont, and always imagined launching a brewery. An entrepreneur at heart and a CPA with extensive experience in accounting, auditing, and insurance, Tony loves building a successful business from the ground up. Tony and Edward began homebrewing and experimenting with different recipes in early 2006, and immersed themselves in all things Craft beer.

lAcrbq,Back Forty Beer Company,"Back Forty is a micro brewery based out of Gadsden, Alabama. With 2 offerings currently distributed throughout the state, Back Forty is the only Alabama based brewery that can be found anywhere from Muscle Shoals to Mobile.    The name Back Forty Beer Company is basically a reference to the back 40 acres of the farm. Tradionally the ""Back 40"" of a farm is the most challenging to maintain, but also produces some of the best yields due to the rich content of the earth. Likewise, Alabama was one of the last States in The Union to update it's outdated beer laws (MS is the only one left), and now it's time to reap those yields.    The craft beer market in Alabama has a lot of room to grow, and we plan on doing everything we can to make that happen. Our main goal is to focus on the local community and support other small business owners while offering up our tasty flavors for the people of Alabama.     The company is founded in Alabama, and just about every aspect of this business is supported by Alabama based suppliers. We've worked with a Design firm out of Athens, AL on our label and logos, our attorney is in Birmingham, our accountant is in Dothan, AL, our shirts are printed in Huntsville and our Brewmaster is out of Montgomery, AL.     We've been working with Jamie Ray (A nationally recognized Brewmaster who has won several medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, CO), for over a year on our first offering, ""Naked Pig Pale Ale"". And we have several ideas in the works for additional year round offerings in the coming months. We're looking forward to producing some great beers that Alabamian's have never tasted before. Once things get up and running, we'll start releasing some seasonal offerings, one-time offerings, limited edition batches, etc. That's what we're really excited about.    The only aspect of this operation that isn't planted firmly in Alabama soil, is the production and packaging. We had to go to another craft brewery in a neighboring state for our first production batches. This is partially due to the enormous start-up costs associated with building a complete brewery operation from scratch. But it's also given us the opportunity to support another regional micro-brewery while we get up and running.",http://www.backfortybeer.com/,2009,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_Lw3eGZ-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_Lw3eGZ-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_Lw3eGZ-large.png,200 North 6th St.,Gadsden,Alabama,35901,34.015484,-86.005585,256-467-4912,,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2009,

eGBo2o,Baltimore-Washington Beer Works,"Our beer was first conceived in Luxembourg between founders Stephen Demczuk and Wolfgang Stark.  Stephen was in Europe doing research in molecular biology and experienced its beer culture that lead to his mid-career crisis.  He started writing about beer, and then tried to open a brewery in Arlon, Belgium but that faltered.  He then formed the first beer-of-the-month club in Europe, Beer Around the World.  Importing beer into Luxembourg, boxing it up and shipping it within the EU.  One supplier of his beers was Wolfgang Stark of Haus de 131 Biere.  Wolfgang imported beer from all over the world.

Tom’s California beer-drinking youth provided him with a strong affinity for the pioneers of micro-brewing, back when Sierra Nevada, Pete’s Wicked, and Mendocino Brewing were small craft brewers. Decades of drinking beer – and specifically micro-brews – have contributed to Tom’s brewing pedigree. (Or so he says.)

From the first batch of beer, Rambler Red, brewing was destined for the garage or outdoors because of the huge mess and bad smell made in the kitchen. So, for the first four years Barley and Vine was making 5-gallon extract batches.  Barley and Vine began sharing the beers with friends and family looking for input and making corrections and changes when needed.  As time went by the brewing skill level and quality of the beer continued to improve.   Changing from 5-gallon extract batched to 10 gallon all-grain batches made a huge difference in the quality of the final product.    Barley and Vine is a nano brewery in the planning.

As you turn off Ramada Drive and onto Marquita Way, you will meander around a majestic oak tree.  This majestic white oak stands in the middle of where the road would have gone, if not for this tree’s historical significance.  If you look closely at the trunk of this old oak, you will notice the mark of an equal armed cross carved into its bark. The cross was carved sometime between 1775 and 1776 when Spanish Lt. Colonel Juan Batista de Anza led more than 240 men, women and children on an overland journey from the frontier New Spain to settle in Alta California.

The brewery, which occupies 9,000 square feet at 429 W. 3rd St in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, was founded by Mike Hiller in July 2007.  Though a native of South Williamsport, Barbarian Chief, Mike Hiller, first entered the craft brewing industry in 1997 as an Account Services Associate for Legendary Distributors, Ltd., of Richmond, Virginia. After nearly a year of distributing beer, an opportunity arose for Mike to work as a brewer for Legend Brewing Company. Mike worked with five other brewers to perform duties at all levels of production including brewing, cellar work, cleaning and maintenance.  After nearly four years of service at Legend Brewing Company, Mike moved to Boston, MA, so his wife, Kira, could attend grad school. Tired of listening to him whine about how much he missed brewing, Kira gave him a home brewing kit as an anniversary gift. Mike began brewing whenever he could find the time. He developed the recipes for Hammerin' Ale, Headbangerz Brown Ale, Square Feet Wheat, Weldspatter I.P.A. and several other beers in five-gallon batches on his apartment's balcony.  Mike was also commissioned by friends and co-workers to brew beer for special occasions.  In fact, Square Feet Wheat was actually first brewed for an art gallery opening featuring works by the Barbarian's logo and label designer, Erick Thomas.  After reading Brewing Up a Business: Adventures in Entrepreneurship by Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head Brewery fame, Mike was inspired to start his own brewery. He spent eight months researching and writing a business plan. Another year was spent gathering support and revising his business plans. Thanks to the support of family, friends and other area businessmen who believed in Mike's dream, Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company is now a reality.",http://www.bavarianbarbarian.com,,N,,,,429 W. 3rd St,Williamsport,Pennsylvania,17701,41.238187,-77.009056,570.332.5050,,Y,N,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,,

Ever since the beginnings of the American Beer Renaissance, I have wanted to brew my own great tasting beer and make it available to the beer drinking public and help people learn about and appreciate beer. Coming from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, beer brewing is in my veins.    Twelve years ago my wonderful wife bought me the ""everything but the kitchen sink"" homebrew kit and it all started. After a few extract brew sessions, I built a 15 gallon brew sculpture and graduated to all-grain brewing, and things really got serious. Now after over 200 brews, BCB is in business!    The brewery is small, we call it a Nano-Brewery, we are hidden in the middle of 38 acres of woods in the heart of North Carolina. Most everything is recycled or made in-house. The Brew-House is an old 20' steel cargo container, the Beer-Garden brew patio is recycled flagstone and granite, nestled under spreading oaks and pines, our cooling water is stored rain water from a cistern, the chickens just love the spent mash. All the ingredients are as fresh as possible, some are even home grown. American malts, hops, and yeast are the mainstay of our beers. The water is from our 450' well and is just as pure and clean as can be. Our small batch brewing lets us assure you that each keg or bottle of beer will be as fresh and wonderful as though we were brewing it for ourselves to drink.",http://www.bearcreekbrews.com/,,N,,,,10538 NC 902 Hwy,Bear Creek,North Carolina,27207,35.6518126,-79.3329623,(919) 200-3930,,N,N,N,Y,nano,Nano Brewery,US,United States,USA,,

Herman’s desire to expand the market for the family’s beer led him to sell the product at the Chicago World’s Fair where it received high acclaim. Since then, Berghoff has continued its success and relevance in the Chicago market and beyond.                  As the craft beer market has evolved, the brand has received fresh, exciting updates. Berghoff changed its brewing location and is now proudly brewed at Point Brewery in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Berghoff has also refreshed itself with updated recipes and packaging. With consulting from brewing experts Randy Mosher and John Hannafan, Berghoff’s new, top-notch beers are ready to satisfy consumer demand.

QkdgSV,Big Muddy Brewing Co,"All over the United States, craft breweries are continuing an American tradition which experienced an almost 50 year drought after the repeal of prohibition. Big Muddy Brewing in Murphysboro, Illinois is much like many of these new “microbreweries” all over the country, reinvigorating an industry and continuing a heritage that has skipped several generations.  Until 1940, Murphysboro was the home of a thriving brewery and until prohibition; it was one of the cornerstones of the town’s industry. In 1910, the Stecher Brewing Company produced more than 40,000 barrels of beer a year. However, passage of the Volstead Act in 1919, which ushered in the era of prohibition, began a slow decline to the brewery’s demise.  Big Muddy Brewing’s founder Chuck Stuhrenberg attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale in the 1980s. After graduation, he opened a franchise of Chicago’s Rosati’s Pizza in Carbondale and in 1990, began another venture, Spray Shield Industries.  It was while Stuhrenberg was in college at SIU that he began making his own beer.  Stuhrenberg and his college buddies would homebrew, and as the years went on, he began to take his hobby more seriously.  Stuhrenberg always had professional brewing in the back of his mind, but it stayed a hobby until 2009. In July, 2009, Big Muddy Brewing finally began production, the first brewery in Murphysboro in over 50 years.  The first beer offered by Big Muddy Brewing is Kinkaid Wheat. It was a recipe popular with Stuhrenberg’s family and friends. It was also something he felt would be a good “craft beer transition brew” for those used to the conventional corporate brew (BMC).  Kinkaid Wheat is currently offered on tap and by bottle in bars, restaurants and liquor stores across Southern Illinois alongside of Big Muddy Brewing’s second selection, “Saluki Dunkel Dog”, a dark, amber/dunkel style beer.  The third and newest addition to Big Muddy Brewing’s lineup is an ale called “Big Muddy Pale Ale”, and future varieties include “Logan’s Lager”.",http://www.bigmuddybrewing.com/,2009,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_5b1YpK-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_5b1YpK-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_5b1YpK-large.png,1430 North 7th Street,Murphysboro,Illinois,62966,37.7823381,-89.3321145,(618) 684-8833,Sat: 11:00 am - 3:00 pm  `,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2009,

The brewers fell in love with the endless flavor profiles available through brewing and the delicate hop profiles only available in incredibly fresh beer and want to share that love with beer drinkers from all over the Sacramento area.    Bike Dog is West Sacramento’s first brewery and the only one in town with a tasting room. We operate a 3 barrel brewhouse (industry speak for really small) on site. Brewing small batches means the beer will always be amazingly fresh and allows for the flexibility to mix it up a little with new recipes getting brewed on a regular basis. Because it will be brewed in such small batches, much of the beer will be available only for purchase in the Bike Dog tasting room — allowing customers to see the beer go from grain to glass and hobnob with the brewers and allowing the brewers to personally nurture the local craft beer community.",http://www.bikedogbrewing.com/,2013,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iW1GUi/upload_pqYKKU-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iW1GUi/upload_pqYKKU-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iW1GUi/upload_pqYKKU-large.png,2534 Industrial Boulevard,West Sacramento,California,95691,38.566263,-121.543518,(916) 432-3376,Fri: 5:00 pm - 9:30 pm  Sat: 2:00 pm - 9:30 pm,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2013,

We’re not against bottling, and we will assuredly reach a point in the future where we will package our beer, but no matter how good a beer is in the bottle, it can never be better than the beer coming from a well managed tap.

rwhsCz,Blue Bee Cider,"Virginia’s first and only urban cidery, Blue Bee Cider is located in the heart of downtown Richmond’s Old Manchester district at the fall line of the James River. The name for Blue Bee Cider is derived from a common name for one of Virginia’s native bees, osmia lignaria, or the blue orchard bee. These hardworking bees are solitary and wild, emerging early in the cool spring just in time to pollinate apple blossoms.    At Blue Bee Cider, we aim to create balanced ciders true to their Virginia roots from a culinary perspective and true to the fruit from a cidermaking one.

The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an ""Entrepreneur of the Year"" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.    Jim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.    One of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: ""What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?""    Each year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, ""I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America."" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.

0k2SXz,Boxcar Brewing Company,"Boxcar Brewing Company is a community-oriented brewing company providing fine crafted beer to be enjoyed with family and friends.  The idea for Box Car Brewing Company originated in 2006 in Tennessee at the wedding of two of its chief members Jason and Kristen Kohser. In the mountains of Tennessee gathered a very small group of friends and family including Jason’s cousin Kymberly and her then boyfriend Jamie Robinson. After an intimate ceremony, the entire group enjoyed a reception complete with homemade guacamole and a tub full of crudely marked “homebrews” prepared by Jason. Prior to this, he had been working in high-end restaurants as a general manager, bartender and food server for over 20 years. He spent several years in Northern California learning the fine art of winemaking at a local winery in Sonoma. During this time Jason realized the beauty of brewing beer and his desire to share his creation(s) with others. He’s been brewing out of his kitchen sink for several years now, slowly perfecting his recipes, offering to teach others the art, and, most importantly, making and drinking some real good beer. Jamie, who has yet to find a brew he will not try, immediately was interested in Jason’s creations and quickly started picking his brain on the processes and formalities for creating these “homebrews”. While sucking down a few well-crafted brews in the hot sun, Jamie and Jason talked about their love of beer and the groundwork was laid.    A few months later, Jamie received a phone call from Jason, who had been mulling over the possibility of moving forward with the beer making, he then proposed the idea of moving to Pennsylvania.

Our goal is to show the whole spectrum of beer, its history, and its evolution. To show beer its proper reverence, as not only ""The people's beverage"", but one that pairs as well with food as wine, and when it's skillfully crafted and not over hopped to hide the flaws in production, it does. The truth is, it takes more skill to make a delicate lager, than a double IPA.

ktgW91,Brevard Brewing Co.,"The world of beer is increasingly one of two extremes.  While large macro-breweries compete to produce the lightest, most flavorless, adjunct laden beers possible, craft breweries strive to out-do one another by making each beer hoppier, bolder, and stronger than the next.  At Brevard Brewing Company, we have set out to give beer lovers the best of both worlds – beer that is both drinkable and flavorful.  We are the only brewery in Western North Carolina to specialize in lagers.     What’s the big deal about lagers? Lagers are cold-fermented and aged over twice as long as ales.  They are more costly to produce, and take more patience to brew. Unlike the big flavors of ales that hide imperfections, lagers demand a higher standard of quality and care, making them a rare find in the craft beer world.  But the result is worth the attention to detail--this painstaking process creates a beer that is clean, smooth, and crisp as opposed to the bold, complex flavor of ales.  The imported German barley, hops, and yeast delivers delicate and refined beers that are delicious and flavorful, yet supremely drinkable.    While German-inspired lagers are my specialty, I will never forget the wonderful contributions that American home brewers have made to the beer world over the past thirty years.  I typically find myself drinking a cold, smooth, Pilsner, but every now and again, my taste buds crave a bold, hoppy American IPA.  This is why Brevard Brewing Company offers American ales in addition to German lagers.  No matter your mood or what you are craving, we have the right beer for you.",http://www.brevard-brewing.com/,2012,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/enoxkn/upload_H1vHPy-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/enoxkn/upload_H1vHPy-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/enoxkn/upload_H1vHPy-large.png,63 East Main Street,Brevard,North Carolina,28712,35.2333243,-82.7333116,,Mon:  4:00pm - 10:00pm Tue:  4:00pm - 10:00pm Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm Thu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm Fri:  2:00pm - 12:00am Sat:  2:00pm - 12:00am Sun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm  Monday-Thursday:  4:00pm - 10:00pm  Friday & Saturday: 2:00pm - 12:00am  Sunday: 2:00pm - 9:00pm,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2012,

Qs29uy,Brewer's Alley Restaurant & Brewery,"Welcome to Brewer’s Alley, Frederick, Maryland’s first Brewpub. Brewer’s Alley is proud to continue the long history of beer making in a town known for its deep appreciation of fine fermented spirits.    Brewer’s Alley was located on what is currently South Court Street. Beer Production ceased in 1901 when a large fire consumed the brewery of John Kuhn, who was the last in a long line of brewers to occupy space along the banks of Carroll Creek. For over 153 years, from the very beginning of Frederick County, Brewer’s Alley was a fixture in the social and economic landscape of Frederick. Ninety-five years after leaving Frederick, Brewer’s Alley is back!    Brewer’s Alley’s location at 124 North Market Street is steeped in Frederick history. The first residents of Frederick held a lottery to raise money to build a town hall and market house on this location in 1765, which was completed in 1769. This structure served its purpose for over 100 years and was witness to the birth of Frederick as a city. The Market House spanned the Civil War, including the ransoming of the city by Confederate General Jubal Early.    In 1873, the bustling town of Frederick replaced the Market House with the ""new"" multifunctional offices, and provided space in the rear for the Frederick Farmer’s Market. Later, the rear of the building was replaced by the present parking deck; the first of it’s kind in town.    As the seat of city government the building was witness to Frederick’s political history, and as an opera house and theatre it has been witness to much of Frederick’s social and entertainment history. The building has hosted such diverse events as a Memorial Service for President McKinley in 1901, the Frederick debut of D.W. Griffith’s film ""The Birth of a Nation"", and the Manhattan Opera Company’s production of ""Madame Butterfly"", in 1926. It also hosted the popular American Legion fundraisers immediately after World War I, and the family pleasers the Mykle and Harden Fair Week Road Shows.    Brewer’s Alley has been fortunate in its efforts to preserve the elegance and glory of the old Opera House by being able to engage Salyer Studio Faux to faux decorate some of the original ceiling panels and columns in mimicked old Italian Sienna marble. The beautiful and captivating glass etching work and stained glass seen throughout the building done by Rusty and Sharon Rowland’s Art in Glass Studio complements this fine craftsmanship. Their rendition of the hop vines on the brewery glass and the stain glass panels in the back dinning room was all done by hand and is a joy to behold.    We are most happy to oversee the building’s latest transformation into the state-of-the-art brewery and restaurant. We hope you enjoy the history and ambiance of our location, as well as the brewery and dining experience.    We opened the doors in July of 1996 and have been serving great beers and wonderful meals to the masses ever since.",http://www.brewers-alley.com,1996,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_8Bijgx-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_8Bijgx-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_8Bijgx-large.png,124 North Market Street,Frederick,Maryland,21701,39.4156043,-77.4107676,301-631-0089,,Y,N,N,Y,brewpub,Brewpub,US,United States,USA,1996,

Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.

CWwxeR,Brüeprint Brewing Company,"The story of Brüeprint Brewing Company begins five years ago in a family kitchen in Holly Springs, North Carolina. It’s in the Wagner kitchen where Eric first combined his passion and talent for gourmet cooking with over 20 years of engineering expertise, specifically in treating water. Who knew that brewing delicious beer was so similar to the science of treating water? The process of releasing enzymes to break down starches into sugar and fermenting the sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide is second nature to a water engineer, while balancing delicious flavor is what a gourmet cook strives for. Hence the “blueprint” for great beer was born! Eric’s unique combination of talents led the way for the one-of-a-kind, handcrafted beer, each as original as a fingerprint.    Better than a recipe, a brewing “blueprint” combines science and great culinary skill to create a Brüeprint.    It’s with this vision that we bring Apex its first handcrafted Brewery—Brüeprint Brewing Company. The Wagner family, that is Brüeprint, is dedicated to traditional social interaction while sampling delicious beer. Our hope is that you’ll rest your phone for a few minutes to have a real conversation, partake in or watch a game with friends, or take in a great band.

One spring day, we made the decision to quit our jobs and start a brewery. Shortly after that, we bought our first homebrew kit and brewed our first few batches. We knew that this is what we wanted to do with our lives. Our family encouraged us and helped us gather enough equipment to open our brewery. We became licensed to sell beer in Washington in January of 2010. We opened our new location and taproom at 2018 E Riverside Ave, Suite #1 in Spokane in May of 2011. We take pride in brewing quality beers made with the freshest ingredients around. All of our brews also contain a special touch of “Budge Bros Magic”.

Our beers are brewed in a 10 bbl extract system that was manufactured Continental Breweries in Toronto Ontario. Upon opening we served 3 of our own beers and 9 other imported beer. We have expanded that to 34 taps making us the largest import and micro brewed draft beer selection in Western NY    The concept was based on having a pub style atmosphere, where you can get casual food and good beer, friendly service all at reasonable prices.

We offer family friendly dining with a children’s play area, as well as a private meeting room for business gatherings and presentations or private events, all within full view of our own brewery.      The restaurant is very much “farm-to-fork,” working closely with North Carolina pasture raised beef farmers supplying beef with no hormones added and antibiotic-free meat that we grind daily to make our hamburgers and all-beef hotdogs.  We work with other farmers growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers for pickles, and lettuce. The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.  We like to say we are like fine dining in a burger joint.  We make the mustard, the slaw, the pickles, the mayo, the aioli, the hotdogs, the relish, the...    We are also a full scale working brewery and brew our own beer.  We have up to eight beers on-tap at any given time creating fresh ales and lagers rotating seasonally throughout the year. We use just malt, hops, yeast and water to craft our beer, leaving out adjuncts and additives. We take wine seriously and feature farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.    Central to Bull City Burger and Brewery’s core values is sustainability; our attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source.

The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of ""Burleigh Inn"", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).    It just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's.

The brewery bottled its own beer in Hudson at one of the country’s earliest bottling facilities (1889) and later at a plant in New York City. The family also malted much of their own grain in their malt houses at the Hudson facility. Neil Evans revives this rich heritage here at the Albany Pump Station. Surviving C.H.

CFIZtr,Cannonball Creek Brewing Company,"Cannonball Creek Brewing Company was founded in January of 2013 by Jason Stengl and Brian Hutchinson.  Jason and Brian met in 2004 at the Mountain Sun family of breweries in Boulder, Colorado were they both learned to hone the craft they love.  With over 15 years of combined professional brewing experience and an uncanny ability to tolerate one another, they decided it was time to take a leap and chase the dream of opening their own brewery.    With both Jason and Brian calling Golden, Colorado home, the choice for a location was obvious.  After settling on a property on the north side of town, they wanted the brewery name to reflect the home town they loved.  After doing some research they learned that the original name for the majestic Clear Creek that runs through the center of Golden was Cannonball Creek.  The historical significance paired with the duo’s love for the iconic Cannonball made the decision a no-brainer and Cannonball Creek Brewing Company was born.    Knowing that they wouldn’t be able to do it all on their own, Jason and Brian called upon former co-worker and professional brewer Jonathan Lee to help run the tasting room and work in the brewery.  Jonathan’s experience as a craft beer bar manager, combined with his professional brewing experience made him the perfect fit.",http://www.cannonballcreekbrewing.com,2013,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/UWtF4X/upload_w0oqNL-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/UWtF4X/upload_w0oqNL-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/UWtF4X/upload_w0oqNL-large.png,393 N.

3oOx9v,Carolina Brewing Company,"""Brewers of Tasty Liquids""    If you request a porter, do you expect someone to carry your bags?  If you were approached by a man carrying a dopplebock, would you run for your life?     You shouldn't     These are just two examples of the more than twenty styles of beer that were commonly available in the United States at the turn of the century. Prohibition and industrialization brought an end to this variety of beer, but now the Carolina Brewing Company is helping to revive these traditional brewing styles.    Unlike some fine wines that get better with age, beer is at its peak when it leaves the brewery. All of our beer is produced in small batches for local distribution to ensure that you get the freshest beer possible.    Purity is one of our top priorities.

lijo4X,Cascade Brewing,"Cascade Brewing Company was established in 1998 by Art Larrance, who has been involved in Oregon's craft beer industry since its inception. Art co-founded one of the state's first microbreweries, Portland Brewing, as well as the Oregon Brewers Festival, which today is one of the world's preeminent craft beer festivals.     Cascade Brewmaster Ron Gansberg got his start in the Northwest wine industry. He crossed over in 1986 and began an eight-year career at BridgePort Brewing Co., where he honed his brewing skills, then moved on to the equipment and engineering side of the industry. As Engineering Manager at BridgePort, Ron directed the design and installation of the 80 bbl brewhouse that is still in operation.     Together, Art and Ron put their 40 years of beer experience to work, designing and installing Cascade's state-of-the-art 10 bbl brewing system in SW Portland, then creating and distributing well-balanced market-priced ales ranging from Pale Ale to Copper to Blond Bock. As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market.     Cascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation's largest craft brewing market.

Look for our beers to start making their way around better known beer bars and beer focused restaurants in San Francisco starting in September.     We have a tasting room in the same building as the brewery and will offer tasters, pints, and growlers. Some beers may be bottled further down the line but for now it's all draft. The only way you can take our beer away is in the form of a growler - which by the way, is a great way to drink beer!     Look for a focus of plenty of hoppy beers, belgian-style saisons, dark beers, and sour beers. We are huge fans of wine and bourbon barrel aged beers as well so it's only natural for us to have a barrel program. Think bourbon barrels loaded with big chewy imperial stouts, excessively hopped IPAs, fruited sour beers, and funky saisons. This is what we love. This is what we are all about.

COTU began back in 2009 when Chris Ray and his brother Phil began brewing beer in their houses. The hobby turned into an obsession, and the obsession has led them to open up a craft brewery in Ashland, Virginia. Located in the heart of Central Virginia, it is affectionately known as “The Center of the Universe”. COTU will be brewing an assortment of ales using only whole ingredients, while sticking to the traditional all-natural method of brewing beer.    The meaning of “Center of the Universe” is important to the founders of COTU. With so much emphasis today on globalization and the lack of corporate stewardship, COTU wanted to be a company that truly embraces the local community. “Center of the Universe,” to COTU, is taking pride in where you live and respecting the people with whom you interact. We believe it is our responsibility to understand and appreciate how our actions affect the community that supports us.

nLsoQ9,Cismontane Brewing,"Cismontane Brewing Co. was started by two native southern Californians, Ross Stewart and Evan Weinberg. They chose the name Cismontane because the geographical area it represents, coastal Southern California from Santa Barbara to San Diego.

Each beer is named after a local feature that is unique to the area.    The Brewery is located on the side of the largest mountain in Orange County in the city of Rancho Santa Margarita. The great views from Santiago peak and the trails through the canyons provide some of the natural inspiration for the beers and the company.    The brewery is small and accessible to all with a warm and comfortable tasting area. So don’t hesitate to come by when in the area.

French Canadian trappers traveling west along the famous Red River Trail discovered this natural spring, which had the most refreshing water. Word of this spring spread and became a regular stop for all settlers going west on the Red River Trail. In 1857 Swiss born naturalist Armond DuPont wrote, “it is a water like no other, unique in its ability to refresh.” He noted, “Though seemingly impossible, a year-round frost forms at the base of this amazing spring.”    The brewery was built at the site of the spring and its water became the basis of all the award winning brews for over 125 years. In addition, the brewery has become the #1 energy drink and specialty drink producer in the country.

PDva3w,Columbia Kettle Works,"We are Rod Smith and Bill Collister. We have been working together for 13 years at Farason Corporation. www.farason.com We became friends quickly due partly for our love of engineering and automation, as well as, our love and passion for craft beers. Our favorite past time has been traveling around visiting craft breweries, brewpubs and taprooms together, along with our wives, for 10 years now. Rod took up home brewing 5 years ago and has become quite proficient at brewing delicious beers to the delight and enjoyment of his colleagues, friends, and family. Rod's talent for brewing and Bill's business experience seemed like a good match for a brewpub that would allow us to continue enjoying Rod's hobby to its fullest extent and share it with many more fellow craft brew enthusiasts. We expect the creation, operation, and continuing evolution of the brewpub to provide us another outlet for our passions by providing a quality product and environment in which to enjoy it, along with meeting and enjoying the company of many people with the same love and passion for high quality craft beer.    Originally we looked all over for a good location starting within a few miles of our homes and extending out as far as Columbia hoping for a place within reasonable driving distance from our homes. We believed the market would, to some extent, come to us. Over several months we looked at numerous potential sites and due to one reason or another couldn't find an acceptable location. We ran into floor restrictions, ceiling height issues, limited parking, zoning issues and unaffordable rent. When we eventually met and talked with David Doolittle, Doolittle Investments LLC, he showed us two potential sites in Columbia. David seemed very interested in bringing our type of business into Columbia and offered us reasonable lease pricing and an honest willingness to work with us to bring our dream of a microbrewery to reality. The drive is 35 minutes from our homes, but after considering the location as fairly equally distant between Lancaster and York (both of which have more than one brewery), and the fact we would be first in Columbia and nearby Marietta and Wrightsville, plus the proximity to Route 30, we were sold on the location. We have since discovered that Columbia Borough is quite willing to help us establish our business in their wonderful town. We are thankful and grateful for their assistance and cooperation and look forward to being a part of the community.    Our brewing equipment consists of a 5bbl brew kettle, a 5bbl mash tun, and a 5bbl hlt. We will have three 5bbl or larger fermenters. We are ale people so we will have blondes, pale ales, IPAs, Porters/Stoudts, bitters, and a variety of Belgian versions as well. We will open with 4 taps and gradually expand to 8.  We expect to open this winter, Nov/Dec., but that is dependent on receipt of the brewing equipment and completion of the site as tentatively scheduled. We will open quitely and plan for a more elaborate grand opening at a later date. This venture is a new experience for us and the people assisting us so we need to start out slowly. Our initial hours will be 5pm to 9pm Thursday and Friday and 12pm to 9pm on Saturday. We are planning a lite menu using seasonal local ingredients whenever possible.",http://www.columbiakettleworks.com/,,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/e3IiS6/upload_dQ4qDv-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/e3IiS6/upload_dQ4qDv-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/e3IiS6/upload_dQ4qDv-large.png,40 North 3rd Street,Columbia,Pennsylvania,17512,40.032531,-76.5036329,(717) 983-4242,,Y,N,N,Y,nano,Nano Brewery,US,United States,USA,,

hG1G1v,Cooperstown Brewing Company,"The Cooperstown area had a significant impact on American Brewing. It started with the introduction of hop farming which flourished here until the end of the 19th century. Back then, Otsego and the surrounding counties produced most of the hops grown in the United States.    Traveling through the upper Susquehanna Valley towards Cooperstown in July 1898, a visitor would have enjoyed the view of hop farms with those beautiful hop vines reaching toward the midsummer sky. Grandfather Eckler ws a hop farmer and he used to say, ""The hop was King in those days!"" His hop farm was in Westville, NY only three miles up the Cherry Valley from where our Brewery is now located. When it came time for the hops to be harvested, Grandma Eckler would ""put up"" a dozen people from ""the City' and they would pick the hops for their room and board and a ""vacation"" in the country. My mother, Cynthia Eckler Hall, said she always loved it when the hop pickers came to the farm. Everyone had a lot of fun during the harvest. When the blight devastated his crop in the early 1900's, grandfather turned to dairy farming.  Settled by Englishmen in the early 1800's, Cooperstown once had two English-style breweries in town. Following that tradition, the Cooperstown Brewing Company was founded in 1994. We brew premium ales, porters, and stouts using the finest two-row English barley malts, West Coast hops and the English Ringwood Yeast.    Grandpa would be pleased if he could see the Brewery. We have hops growing here that survived the devastating blight to New York hop farming and those hops grown here are used to finish our Back Yard India Pale Ale.",http://www.cooperstownbrewing.com/,1994,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ybdwZK/upload_liqoWx-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ybdwZK/upload_liqoWx-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ybdwZK/upload_liqoWx-large.png,110 River Street,Milford,New York,13807,42.605397,-74.981902,607-286-9330,,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,1994,

7gNNRF,Council Brewing Company,"Council Brewing Company, established in 2013 and opened in 2014, is a small batch brewery, located in the Kearny Mesa area of San Diego.     Our tasting room has been deliberately crafted to create a destination for people from all walks of life to come together, converse, and fellowship over truly fine craft beer. The name ""Council"" was chosen because it conveys this sense of community; a place where peers come together to deliberate, debate, and make decisions. The tasting room has a warm, inviting feeling, with green, tan, and rustic red toned walls, soft brown flooring and rich Mahogany bar tops. Careful thought was placed into the low music sound levels and decision to not install televisions in order to promote conversations.     We place a tremendous emphasis on creating exemplary beer, crafted to the highest standards. We brew beers that are unique and extremely flavorful, focusing on Ales hailing from American, Belgian, and English origins. No matter what the style, we focus on creating intense aromas and flavors that are very well balanced and drinkable. Click over to ""Our Beer"" to find out more about our beer offerings.

WtMfgN,Crabby Larry's Brewpub Steak & Crab House,"In 1990 Larry came up with the idea to sell produce from the corner of Rt. 463 and Lower State Road. He took Dani and the three kids to meet the owner of the property, Al Walters. Mr. Walters took an immediate liking to the Jones family and allowed Dani and Larry to sell produce from his corner. Being a farmer, he even started growing corn and other vegetables for them. One day, Larry's father showed up with a bushel of live crabs and left them with Dani to sell. The crabs sold so fast that they picked up more crabs, shrimp, and other types of seafood too. In 1994, Mr. Walters passed away and Dani and Larry had to move on to bigger and better things. They rented a space in the Chalfont Village Shopping Center and opened a restaurant and fresh fish market. Dani and Larry did all the cooking. Larry would go to the fish market daily to ensure the freshest seafood. And with the help of loyal family and friends, Jones Family Seafood became a popular seafood restaurant in the area.      Early in 2001, Larry received a mailing, the kind we all ignore, advertising ""Brew your own beer"". He was immediately hooked. After convincing Dani that this was a good idea, they met up with a ""brew master"", ordered the equipment, and they were on their way.",http://www.crabbylarrys.com/,1990,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/m6aqF7/upload_OQ2A32-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/m6aqF7/upload_OQ2A32-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/m6aqF7/upload_OQ2A32-large.png,237 West Butler Avenue,Chalfont,Pennsylvania,18914,40.2795164,-75.2142895,215-822-8788,,Y,N,N,Y,brewpub,Brewpub,US,United States,USA,1990,

yqQtUG,Brewery & Restaurant,"If you could be doing whatever you want right now, what would you be doing? For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be ""listening to live music and drinking craft beer."" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.     There was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.     It was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.      Everyday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running ""off the grid"" as well.     Ken, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.

CA3UzH,Dark Horse Brewing Company,"Humble beginnings gave way to lessons learned of brewing in the shadows of the residence hall; steering clear of the landlord and having your ass handed to you by the almighty dollar are now consumed by the glory bells of success and the daily grind - a dichotomy of sorts… Should a young madman have to bend and be Ned Beatty’d to sell and serve to please the public eye’s nerve endings from the very beginning? Not this time around.     A brewer slowly climbed from the lowest points of business life with a sore ass, as he ascended to a new level. Hark! The horse of the dark nature holds the scales where the wheat and barley feedeth, not taketh from the mouths of man. A non-filtered view of hard work, careful perseverance of expansion, sticking to what is believed to be the right way and the only way to stay true to high quality, and also, the vague understandings of possible humor; blurring his family’s, employees’ and customers’ drinking experience and vision between a no-bullshit approach to brewing big, outstanding beers and selling nonsensical imagery and haberdashery…Proven to the masses as a Darkhorse trademark for the man behind the reigns.     Can true patrons of quality, time and devotion deal with the inner workings of a mad-man’s psyche as he speaks of visions of smacking Umpa Lumpas with snow shovels, or allows the obscure drawings of lawn jarts and tinker toys to be hung on the walls of his establishment? They seem to…A madman’s passion for brewing comes out in strange ways indeed; where his employees and fellow brew house boys may know not how to deal with his tongue twisted ramblings and contortions of the face at first; where the same can definitely scare away newcomers.     True patrons know how to accept the obscure humor. Some have lent a hand in some way or another. They know what “pour to the line” means; they have been to every annual crawfish boil and some find the passion within themselves to put the Darkhorse name to skin…still they barely understand the immature drawings created in the brewery… True patrons know the hard work the brewers put in to create and keep the Darkhorse name in the lead.     Some things in life are easily read and some things keep you guessing. Should we take turns consuming garage sale items and vomiting them on the walls or should we follow the square, straight and narrow? Slip into the pub and look around. Go out and buy a six-pack, and read the holder the beer comes in. Read the back of your growler. When you’re done, you’ll either get it or you won’t. No matter, as you’re drinking some of the best fuckin’ beer made in the great state of Michigan.

TkT8Rc,Dick's Brewing Company,"Dick Young started brewing as a home brewer in 1984 and sold homebrew supplies at his business, Northwest Sausage & Deli.  When he wasn’t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick’s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick’s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick’s Brewing Company became a reality.    Dick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, “I started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty”.   And we are all so grateful he was.    The brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick’s Beers were flying out the door.  In 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.    Dick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.    Today, the Dick’s Brew Crew is led by Dick’s daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick’s legacy.  All of us here at Dick’s are proud to continue the dream that our founder started, and we are proud to have you all along for the ride.",http://dicksbeer.com/,1984,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_vNkqm1-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_vNkqm1-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/GC3a1f/upload_vNkqm1-large.png,5945 Prather Road,Centralia,Washington,98531,46.771347,-123.007543,800-586-7760,Fridays 3pm - 7pm,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,1984,

UfTXZT,Dirty Hands Brewing Company,"The road to the creation of Dirty Hands Brewing began during those halcyon days of college where Grant (UCLA) and Phil (University of Utah/University of Wyoming) started developing an appreciation for great beer. They first met during graduate school at the University of Minnesota where the fates would have it, they joined the same chemistry research group.  The guys spent many a night proving the adage of their PhD (piled higher & deeper) advisor, “The true test of running a scientific instrument is being able to operate it after a few beers.”  After graduation, Grant and Phil pursued different career paths, Grant went the academic route, while Phil initially started out in the chemical industry, but then wised up and conned people into hiring him as a beer then wine chemist.  After a few years of chasing the academic and corporate dollar, the boys wised up and decided to strike out on their own.  They landed in Vancouver, WA (which was the first Vancouver, by the way) and started up Dirty Hands Brewing Company.  From the start, their goal was to brew full flavored beers that were both balanced and highly drinkable.  So, they set to work, getting their hands dirty renovating the space that was the old Columbian Newspaper building to a working brewery and taproom.  Speaking of the newspaper, that’s how the name came about.  Think of reading a hard copy paper and how your hands would look from getting newsprint all over them!

Founded in 2009, Draai Laag began as a way to introduce beer with creative flavors into the market, offering a bit of variety in a world of Pilsners, Pales Ales and Porters.    Here at Draai Laag we use old world methods, such as bottle conditioning by aging our ales on lees.  We brew in small batches and use several strains of yeast to produce our beers.   The drinker may notice slight nuances from batch to batch.  But, you will find that all our ales are aged and, just like a fine wine, can be laid down for extended periods.   This results in a unique drinking experience each time a bottle is opened.    Here at Draai Laag we like to cater to those that want something respectful of tradition, but ultimately different.  Those who are not satisfied drinking the norm.  Most importantly, we get our biggest enjoyment and fulfillment not from profit, but from your smile after the first sip.

Jim's grandfather owned five taverns in Chicago and his father owned one in Phoenix off Indian School rd. You could say that beer runs in our family blood.    Tradition is important to the Dubina's. While Jared has a fun and creative side, the Dubina Brewing team feel that staying traditional and incorporating the worlds beer history in their beer is just as important as creating new brews.

wW6rQJ,Eastern Shore Brewing Co,"Eastern Shore Brewing opened it's doors September of 2008 by owners Adrian and Lori Moritz.  Both had an entrepanerial passion, but never thought of a microbrewery as their business.  ""The decision was made for us.  Make a business out of something you love to do and you will never work another day in your life"" the couple states.  A lot of hard work and a love for good beer motivates the business.   We decided to open Eastern Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael's Winery, and were told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers took home medals in the Maryland Govenor's cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael's Amber ALe) on October 9th.  And although happy with the medals, Eastern Shore Brewing's goals are to continue to grow the busines and improve their products.  Distribution ranges from Cambridge to Kent Island on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and recently moved into Ellicott City, Maryland.  A new fermenter will be arriving shortly after the new year, which will increase capacity even further.

E6WUse,Engine 15 Brewing Company,"Engine 15 Brewing Co. was born of the need for great beer!  Way back in 1988, Luch Scremin was a Freshman in college and became interested in brewing his own beer.  Since the internet did not exist, Luch was forced to order a “beer kit” from an ad in the back of an issue of Popular Mechanics.  Suffice it to say that what resulted was indeed beer but was far from great.    Fast forward twenty years and the love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew.  Luch traveled the world with his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles and beer culture.  In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub,  Luch met his future business partners Andy and Sean.  The three were soon making the business a reality.    All that was left was a name.  They soon decided they would name the brewery for Luch’s 1962 Ford Fire Engine – after all, they just don’t make them like that anymore.  It represents all that Engine 15 Brewing Co. is about. Camaraderie, old school know how, determination and a simple but serious dedication to the cause.  As of 2011, Engine 15 Brewing Co. has enjoyed success and was even voted best Pub and Brewpub  in Jacksonville by the Folio Weekly readers poll.  At Engine 15 Brewing Co. you’ll find a friendly atmosphere where you can enjoy a dizzying array of beers, both brewed in house and imported from the far reaches of the globe, eat a tasty meal and even brew your own beer!

YKa9wh,Equinox Brewing Company,"The most common question we get is, why Equinox Brewing? The equinox, and the intrigue of equal night and day, has deep roots in history and ritual. But, at the same time, the equinox marks the changing of the season, and forces us to look toward the future. We find it interesting that the two days out of the year that have perfect light and dark balance also show the balance between the past and the future, tradition and innovation. Beer contains similar elements. Sure, there’s the balance of flavors in a beer; sweet and bitter, rich and simple…    We find another aspect of beer’s balancing act fascinating. Historically, beer styles have developed because of limitations in local ingredients and the necessity to make do with what you have. However, due to global trade and modern shipping methods, limitations on ingredients have been removed. We can get any ingredients we want. While most modern brewers recognize the importance of beer styles and learn from the brewers who made them, they certainly don’t limit themselves to making beers that fit into traditional definitions.    On one level our beers fit into some traditional styles, but we put our own twist on them. We want our beers to capture elements from the past and incorporate new ideas, ingredients and techniques into them. We’re not afraid to try new things.

MWi5Kp,Esser's Cross Plains Brewery,"Arriving in Madison, Wisconsin on May 11, 1852 from a village in Germany called Ichendorf, George Esser possessed little more than the clothing on his back, a talent for masonry, and a taste for good, traditional German beer. Esser started producing lager in a small brewery he bought in Monroe for $1,500. In 1863, he purchased 2 1/2 acres of land in Cross Plains. The original building had two cellars below and several rooms above to house Esser's family. The beer, known as Esser's Best, was first brewed in October, 1863. He was joined in this enterprise in 1881 by his son Jacob. At that time, the brewery had a capacity of 2,000 barrels. A barrel of beer cost $7, and a case containing 36 pint bottles was priced at $1.75. Jacob and his sons, primarily Werner (W.B.) and Peter (Spundt) began delivering beer to the surrounding communities, often starting out as early as 3 a.m. Werner acted as Brew master from 1907 to 1910. It was increased competition from the larger breweries that forced him to become a distributor. The first beer that he handled as a distributor was Hausmann's originally brewed in Madison in 1920, Werner became the distributor for Blatz Near Beer. Following Prohibition in 1933, the company again to distribute beer. It should be noted that during prohibition, Werner and his brothers were kept very busy taking care of the beer needs in the area, mostly doing business at night. In 1937, Werner's eldest son, Roman, became a partner. At this point, the company began to handle Old Style products out of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The family tradition continued when Del Esser, Werner's youngest son, joined the firm in 1948. In 1988, Roman's son, Wayne, took over the business. In 1990, Wayne was joined in the business by his son, Larry, which made six generations of Essers in the bee business. It should also be noted that the Essers were distributors of Blatz and Old Style products until they sold the distributorship in January 1998 to Frank Beer in Middleton, Wisconsin. Frank beer is currently the distributor of Esser's Best in the area.",http://www.essersbest.com/,1852,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xHovlT/upload_RDu1B5-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xHovlT/upload_RDu1B5-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xHovlT/upload_RDu1B5-large.png,2109 Hickory Street,Cross Plains,Wisconsin,53528,43.114731,-89.653129,1-608-798-3911,,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,,

g3aigX,Falling Down Beer Company,"Falling Down Beer Company (FDBC) is the newest craft brewery in the state of Michigan. Continuing the tradition of Michigan and Craft brewers before us, we will create unique hand crafted Ales and Lagers, that will challenge expectations and ideas of what great beer really is. With a focus on premium quality, handmade Ales and Lagers, FDBC will present a new unique product to the Detroit area.    Made in Michigan and the U.S.A.    One of the missions of FDBC is to create jobs and spur the economy in Michigan and the U.S. in general. At opening we plan to have 18 positions available with that number doubling year to year. Our long term goal is a bottling factory and additional restaurants that will employee hundreds of local workers.    Keeping with our philosophy of locally sourced goods and services, we will purchase from local companies whenever possible. On the food side this includes local fish markets, meat markets and bakeries; and on the brewery side designing beers that will be made using Michigan grown hops and malt. And it doesn’t stop there! We are actively negotiating and designing the brew house, promotional materials, general construction and website operations with Michigan companies.    Where it is not possible to source a product or service locally or in the State of Michigan, we will be looking first to keep our business in the Mid-West and then United States. We call this an inside-out sourcing philosophy. First source at the city level and slowly work out by county, state, region and country. We feel this benefits everyone in this endeavor where we support the community that is supporting us. A Win-Win for everyone!    It’s All About the Beer!    We are going to be creating quality; handcrafted beers that we believe will be some of the best beer you have ever tried. We are also going to push the envelope and make beers with unique and far-out ingredients that will invite you to be different and maybe live a little on the edge.

As George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an “amateur mountaineering expedition” to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves.

That’s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don’t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn’t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn’t make this extraordinary journey.

Muller said the idea was to make the Web site “This Old House meets the World Wide Web”—letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.    He also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.    Muller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school.

With a focus on the revival of artisan brewing, we strive to create the highest quality products available.    Brewing techniques as timeless as beer itself are used to create a uniquely handmade product. We craft the finest possible beer in small batches normally not found in the industry today which is typically dominated by mega mergers of international breweries. Is this difficult and more time consuming? Yes. Does it require more manual labor? Yes. Is it worth it? Unequivocally, YES. As beer is a “living, breathing” product made from precise strains of active yeast cultures, it just makes good sense to nurture the product in very manageable small batches. We believe that the extra care and attention devoted to each batch produces the best possible result and you as our friends deserve no less.    We hope that you will have the opportunity to experience the limited quantities of hand crafted beer that we produce in Charlotte. When you do, please notice the complexities of the aroma, the silkiness of its body, and the explosion of flavors as the grains merge artfully with the yeast cultures and noble hops blended meticulously for each variety.

FEPzbD,Freedom Brewery,"Established in 1995, Freedom Brewery is a pioneer of premium craft lager brewing in the UK. Now one of the leading brewery’s in this sector, Freedom’s range of beers have won over 25 International and National awards in the last 4 years alone.    All Freedom Beer is bottom fermented in closed, pressurized vessels. Lager is fermented at a lower temperature than ale and therefore takes longer – between 7 to 14 days, in contrast to 4 to 5 days. During fermentation, the beer naturally carbonates itself as a result of the breakdown of sugars to alcohol.    After the fermentation stage, the ‘young’ beer is transferred to maturation or storage tanks, where it’s stored at -1 ?C. Freedom Brewery has a minimum maturation period of 4 weeks; this improves both the beer’s flavour profiles and naturally increases its stability, removing the need for chemical intervention. The verb ‘Lagerun’ is German for ‘to store’ – ironic as the majority of mass produced ‘lagers’ are brewed within days, with little or no maturation time at all.    Freedom Brewery sterile triple filters its beers to remove any remaining yeast and protein cells. This is instead of pasteurisation which, whilst being a cheaper process, carries the risk of ruining the beer’s natural flavours. Freedom’s first sterile filtration uses diatomaceous earth in contrast to isinglass, which is a substance obtained from the swim bladders of fish. As a result, all Freedom Beers are certified by the Vegan Society.",http://www.freedombeer.com/,1995,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zgCDhX/upload_0hOLyo-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zgCDhX/upload_0hOLyo-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zgCDhX/upload_0hOLyo-large.png,5430 Shiloh Forest Dr,Midlothian,Texas,76065,32.517917,-96.923991,321-745-9819,,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,,

basAdv,Funkwerks,"In 2007 Gordon Schuck’s recipe design and brewing skills resulted in a gold medal-winning Saison at the National Homebrew Competition. Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.     Saisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.     Funkwerks’ two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.     Funkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm. Brewery tours are given Saturdays at 2pm.     Funkwerks is currently distributed in:  Colorado:  American Eagle Distributing and C.R.

DuaynM,Funky Buddha Lounge & Brewery,"Funky Buddha Brewery was founded in 2010 in Boca Raton, Florida, and is committed to producing bold craft beers that marry culinary-inspired ingredients with time-honored technique. Our mantra is big, bold flavors, made exactingly with natural ingredients. So, for example, if we say a beer will taste like peanut butter and jelly, you can be sure you’ll smell and taste the fresh roasted peanuts and fruity berry jam. Our flagship beers such as Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen, also strive towards big, bold flavor. It’s who we are.    Our Brewery is located in the heart of Oakland Park’s new Culinary Arts District. The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida’s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.    You can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida. And of course, we still brew at our original location in Boca Raton, the Funky Buddha Brewery & Lounge, which has become a test kitchen for our more experimental brews.    See you soon for a pint!

SY2b6E,Furthermore Beer,"Furthermore bought a building way back in 2005 with the hopes of shoe-stringing together an undersized, Frankenstein-style brewery. The reason for so lofty a goal was of course to cheaply serve the more important purpose of the business--getting beer to the beer drinker, putting bottles on the shelf. However, even “cheap” was expensive to us. Pinching pennies and moving cautiously wasn’t helping us reach our self imposed deadline of Summer of 2006. Then we met the good folks at Sand Creek Brewing Co (Black River Falls, WI) who agreed to bring us on as customers, allowing us to use their facility to get the beer brewed. We were thus able to skip the hard lessons of construction pitfalls and went straight to filling stainless steel tanks with beer.     The scrape-together building and used equipment model was then blacked out from the “Phase 1” section of the business plan. Aran went on the road to be hands on at Sand Creek; Chris went on the road to sell beer. We have since acquired another property in Spring Green (known affectionately as the Shitty Barn), and we have often been heard threatening to build a brewery on this site, sometimes quite convincingly. But “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” seems to be the winning adage. So until we break it, we won’t likely fix our present model.     So that is the back story--the mental seasoning for your next sip of Furthermore Beer. Fair warning to the newcomer: those who like our beers always seem to find at least one to stick in the “hate” column—ant that’s always one that someone else places in the “love” column with a glittery heart sticker next to it. So remember, if you have distaste for one of our beers, it could our failings, or it could be your poor upbringing and resulting prejudices--so hate with an open mind.",http://www.furthermorebeer.com/,2005,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JuFsla/upload_dFOuLs-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JuFsla/upload_dFOuLs-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JuFsla/upload_dFOuLs-large.png,525 East Madison Street,Spring Green,Wisconsin,53588,43.18111,-90.072391,608-588-3300,,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,,

rqVDmz,Geaux Brewing,"Geaux started in a garage…like most startups—in the summer of 2011. Except, it wasn't a garage in someone's house but rather in Jeremy's business. With concrete floors and roll up doors, it was the perfect place to brew beer—and no spouses would be ticked that their kitchen or home was getting trashed in the process. The reason for wanting to ""home"" brew? Because the Friday beer parties at his business were starting to rack up some serious expenses. After all, we wanted to drink the good stuff and 22oz. bombers ain't cheap. So, Jeremy got the crazy idea (as he often does) to figure out a way to make beer so that we didn't have to spend so much money on other people's beer.     The problem was…where to start? Jeremy knew he wanted to brew beer but the reality was that with so many home brewers out there—each with their own opinion on how to do things—it was going to be a challenge to corral and sift through the information he needed to get started and actually brew good beer.     After a few ""test"" batches that yielded sub-standard beer, he got serious and started researching and researching and doing even more research until that first ""golden"" batch came through. Eventually, the challenge went from brewing good beer to brewing good beer consistently. Again, with more research, he figured it out. Then, he got the idea. ""What about other new or rookie home brewers out there? Aren't they facing the same problems I am? Wouldn't they and new home brewers want a convenient location to get it hands-on information about brewing?"" At that moment, Geaux went from a hobby to a serious endeavor to bring professional-level brewing techniques to the home brewing community. Then, the REAL fun began.    Going from a ""home"" brewing operation to a commercial brewery (which is required if you plan to brew anywhere outside of home…even if you don't sell it (oops.)) was a bit more than anyone ever envisioned. After a year of plodding away at paperwork, construction, and using up every ounce of goodwill from family and friends, the Geaux brewery and tap room opened up to the public on October 19th, 2013.",http://geauxbrewing.com,,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DaJPkB/upload_xfHLsD-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DaJPkB/upload_xfHLsD-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DaJPkB/upload_xfHLsD-large.png,12031 Northup Way,Bellevue,WA,98005,47.6304115,-122.1797945,425-505-8765,Mon:  4:00pm - 8:00pm Tue:  4:00pm - 8:00pm Wed:  4:00pm - 8:00pm Thu:  3:00pm - 9:00pm Fri:  3:00pm - 9:00pm Sat:  12:00pm - 8:00pm Sun:  1:00pm - 6:00pm  Last call 15 min prior to close.

The name Gentle Ben’s was chosen through a contest and the winner was a University professor who thought the manager looked like Dan Haggerty from the T.V. show Grizzly Adams whose co-star was a bear named Gentle Ben. That show was based on a man who roamed parts of Northern California in the 1920s and 30s. He had two bears, Benjamin Franklin and Martha Washington.

I came up with a process that allows me to get a rather large amount of body, equivalent to the body of an IPA, but with the finish of a light beer.”    “We’re bringing beer to the market that ale drinkers will enjoy, because they’re going to be different and flavorful, and we’ll grab some of the mainstream drinkers. Take my son,” Duenwald says. “He’s in his 30s, living in Seattle. He’ll start the night out drinking a Mac & Jack’s or a Mirror Pond. He might even have two of them.

MSB2i0,Golden Valley Brewery,"Best Brew Pub in the Heart of Wine Country!    Since we started in 1993, we've followed a fresh, local, made-in-house cuisine program at Golden Valley.    We've always had our own kitchen garden supplying the restaurant, and sourced fresh vegetables, fruits, meat, fish and poultry from local producers whenever possible.    Our chef Greg Meixner orchestrates the procurement of fresh, healthy, great tasting foods for you and your family.    Everyone knows the rich, fresh and natural taste of our beef but few realize how we do it.    Since 2003, GVB owners Peter & Celia Kircher have also owned and operated the Angus Springs Ranch on 76 acres of rolling spring fed pastures outside McMinnville.    Golden Valley Brewery grain makes ideal feed for our select Black Angus herd because it contains twice the protein and fiber of regular feed.     Our Angus are raised on an all natural program of spring fed pastures and premium rations for up to 12 months and then dry aged for 21 days insuring beef of exceptional quality and tenderness.    No hormones, antibiotic feeds, or animal by products are used in the production of our beef.     Our goal is to produce the finest all natural beef in the Northwest!",http://www.goldenvalleybrewery.com/,1993,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vm4OsK/upload_gRUPMU-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vm4OsK/upload_gRUPMU-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vm4OsK/upload_gRUPMU-large.png,980 Northeast 4th Street,McMinnville,Oregon,97128,45.21039,-123.189017,503-472-2739,Mon - Thu: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm  Fri - Sat: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm  Sun: 11:00 am - 9:00 pm,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,1993,

pj4HJk,Good People Brewing Company,"Like most real brewers, Good People started out with humble beginnings and no intention of ever starting a business. A labor of love in which long brew days in the garage, bad equipment, curious dogs (we still blame them for a bad batch or two) and hanging out with friends became commonplace. Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).    We took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It’s pretty fun to have someone you don’t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn’t set out to start a business, the business just found us.     “Once in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right” Robert Hunter    We wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners.     Good People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company….to be good people.     In September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together. It was a long, frustrating, and tiring process….but it was flat worth every bit of it all.    So if you are looking for something made in small batches with high quality ingredients and pride, please give us a shot.    The Brewery  We brew on a two kettle, combi-tank and brew kettle, 20 bbl system manufactured by New World Systems.

Enthusiasts continue to bring in glasses, pictures, and artifacts from the turn-of-the century brewery. One woman found half of the original sign that hung on the Ionia and Michigan Street building—as she was cleaning her great uncle's inherited barn. The sign was facing down and being used as a shelf.    In a different incident, the brewery was called by archeologists digging at a Michigan training camp for soldiers during the Spanish-American War.

The original 1903 Bolick’s bottling plant still stands as and within the brick walls along the left side of the building and lobby interior. Come celebrate with us 110 years of beverage production and bottling onsite!     History: in December 2012, Mastroeli-MacNeil Equity Investments financed the purchase of this 31,690 square foot configuration of two warehouses, situated on 2.08 acres contiguous to Downtown Granite Falls. A panoramic view of the Blue Ridge Mountains runs the rear of the building. The owners financed a painstaking build-out, and are proud of the adaptive reuse of this warehouse/manufacturing space into a supper club, eatery, and old-style ""watering hole.""     The Brewery: GFB is a 30BBL/(40BBL) craft beer production facility. We brew onsite and within sight while you indulge your senses in our Southern Gastropub restaurant and attached Tasting Room. Our brewpub features a wraparound 103-foot-long tasting counter, copper/penny-topped wine bar, and serves as a world-class music venue. Eclectic artifacts dress the spaces for those with an itch for the odd or unique.

wI1wn8,Granite Mountain Brewing,"Granite Mountain Brewing is what happened when two couples - the Stangersons (Michael Stanger and Amanda Richardson) and the Swaffamotos (Damon Swafford and Audra Yamamoto) - got together (perhaps all-too-frequently) to enjoy good food and Michael's homebrew. Our shared love of food and beer propelled us to start an underground beer tasting movement during which we hosted a series of 7 beer tasting events over the course of a 13 months. We may be the new kids on the Prescott scene, but GMB brings ten years of brewing experience to the table. From the farmlands of Vermont to the mountains of Alaska; the homelands of Idaho and now the high deserts of Prescott!     GMB opened the doors on the brewery and taproom in August 2012. By small operation, we mean SMALL. Not micro. We're talking about nanobrewing here, folks. We're a grassroots endeavor that began in a garage and garnered fast support from the community.     We pride ourselves on high-quality unpretentious beer. We like to brew traditional styles as well as creative twists on the traditional. Inspired by the local landscape and community, we look forward to experimenting with local ingredients (wheat berries, juniper berries, prickly pear fruit) and becoming part of the local flavor of Prescott. Beer education is part of what we do: styles, processes, ingredients, and the magical pairing between beer and food. Why? Because this is all part of celebrating the simpler things in life: good food, good friends, good beer.",http://www.granitemountainbrewing.com/,2010,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qtLQ7F/upload_LWdiOR-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qtLQ7F/upload_LWdiOR-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qtLQ7F/upload_LWdiOR-large.png,123 N Cortez St,Prescott,Arizona,86301,34.5427831,-112.4686784,(928) 778-5535,Wed - Thu: 4:00 pm - 9:00 pm  Fri: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm  Sat: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm  Sun: 1:00 pm - 6:00 pm,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2010,

Well, for us, there's a lot of anticipation in tasting a new beer. The way the foam settles in a glass of dark stout, or the raining effect you can see in a pint of IPA served on nitro... they remind us sometimes of the expectant feeling we get watching powerful storms roll in over the mountains in our home town of Colorado Springs. Yes, we tend to wax poetic over a pint glass. I told you we love beer. But anyway, that was part of the inspiration. The other part was our beloved half Husky, half Aussie brewdog, Storm. He's a little... wild. Like our beers.      We hope you'll find the same passion for drinking our beers as we do for making them. Come in and see us, we'll be pleased to pour you a pint.

AlhRYb,Greenbush Brewing Co,"Good ideas often start over beer. Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.    So with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. ""We're on to something"", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.    This led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our ""anything goes"" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.    Now, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.    Stop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs.

1irs0u,Greenport Harbor Brewing Company,"The idea began a long time ago over … well … a pretty terrible beer.  You see we (John from NY and Rich from Boston) met in college and had to drink what beer we could afford in those days.    As the years went by, the better the beer we consumed, the more we were consumed by it.  We tried every beer imaginable.  We read about beer. We talked about beer. We began making our own beer.  And finally we started talking and dreaming about opening a brewery on the North Fork.    In the Spring of 2008 the dream became a reality when Rich heard about an old firehouse for sale in the Village of Greenport.  Driven by thirst more than brains, we bought the building in the middle of what has been called a Global Economic Meltdown.  Next we started the renovation.  Did we mention Global Economic Meltdown?  We tried to do most of the work ourselves and luckily got a lot of help from some good friends and family.   The promise of beer can be powerful. Our luck continued when on a snowy January day, with no roof on our brewery, we got a visit from DJ Swanson and his 2 young children. No one in their right mind would have joined us. DJ did and agreed to be our new head brewer. In April with roof replaced, windows installed, and drains dug, our brew house arrived and the idea of making Greenport Harbor beer began. Four months later in July of 2009 we were officially shipping (hand truck and family cars) our beer.    Today our beer is served in over 200 places on Long Island (thank you Justin) and NYC.    We’re proud to say that since summer of 2009 we have been singled out for nearly every beer we have brewed from the Village Voice to the Tasting Table to TimeOut NY to Newsday to NY Examiner to Wall Street Journal to countless beer and food blogs.  We have a total of 13 employees if you include our forklift and delivery truck, which we do. We hope to add to this number in the next few months when we grow by 66 and 2/3’s percent by adding 2 new tanks. We are the only local brewery that brews 100% of our beer. We are small but hungry…we mean thirsty.",http://www.harborbrewing.com/,2009,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/b15cO3/upload_F15kbe-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/b15cO3/upload_F15kbe-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/b15cO3/upload_F15kbe-large.png,234 Carpenter Street,Greenport,New York,11944,41.1024718,-72.3589459,631-477-6681,Open for Tastings/Growlers/Retail:  Fri & Sat 12-7pm  Sun 12-6pm,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2008,

So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn’t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.      We still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment.

Ramstein beers are made with the same care and precision that Greg learned in Germany. In fact, the wheat, barley, hops and yeast used to make Ramstein Beers are all imported directly from Bavaria.    Greg found a special brewer’s yeast used only by a small brewery in Bavaria. He was able to get the brewery to let him use the special yeast exclusively at High Point. The unique, complex character of Ramstein beers is a result of this private yeast and of course, High Point’s careful and proper brewing methods.    The name Ramstein was adopted from a town in Germany with a large American population. The town surrounds the U.S. Ramstein Air Force Base. High Point wanted the name of its beers to reflect a marriage of German tradition and American innovation.

4z9si8,Holy Brew Brewing Company,"The inner battle of good and evil was never more apparent than when one takes that first cleansing sip of HolyBrew. While your ""good"" nature will definitely be aroused by this cool, spirit-raising refreshment, your inner evil will soon begin to feel less inhibited, allowing initial laughter and fun to soon require an internal battle of self-restraint.    History - Since the dawn of mankind, we have struggled with the battle of good and evil. To drown in guilt or sorrow is unhealthy and seen by some as wasted emotions. In opposition, to live our lives completely without impure influence and to be seen by all as “up-tight” without the ability to cut loose on occasion is viewed in equally a negative fashion. Until now, there has never been a respectable or enjoyable solution to this life long struggle.  HolyBrew is a positive channel for cleansing one’s mind, body and spirit of unwanted or unnecessary guilt, doubt or unhappiness. Through a recently discovered magical formula, believed to be created from the gods themselves, HolyBrew has formulated the “Liquid Confession”. What better way to cleanse one’s soul than to partake of this succulent brew, confess one’s sins and erroneous ways and let the weight of their guilt be lifted and their thirst quenched simultaneously.  Join the movement in guilt-free pleasure and refreshment.

xZTJW3,Iron Horse Brewery,"The Iron Horse Brewery that opened its doors in December of 2004 was a bit different than today. It had a very mom and pop feel, and featured a look that was as traditional as it gets. Those who knew of it visited regularly, but the regulars were few. For many, the brewery was a thing shrouded in mystery... college students-which comprise a fair percentage of Ellensburg's population for most of the year-would occasionally see a bottle on a store shelf and ask where it came from. The likely response:    ""Yeah, I think some dude makes that in his basement or something...""    The word just wasn't getting out, and things didn't look good for the tiny brewery that made exceptionally tasty ales.   Well, a couple of hoodlums in their late-twenties jumped on the opportunity to own and operate their own brewery, and what resulted is the Iron Horse Brewery you know and love today. They tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good things started to happen. Locals started to dig what the guys were doing. A few bars took a chance and put Iron Horse back on tap, and the beer started flowing.

Soon he found himself president and heading up the Marin County State Fair competitions, and after burning out all the burners on the stove, he was banished to brewing outdoors. A certified beer judge, he worked at Marin Brewing Company before starting off on his own, moving south to Carpinteria. Now a family run brewery, Island Brewing Company has won awards on both the state and national level.

CPYUBy,Jack Pine Brewery - Taproom,"Most homebrewers, at some point, begin to dream of starting their own brewery.  I had always liked my beer, but I realized that there tends to be a brewer’s bias towards their own beer.  A great deal of time and effort goes into making a batch of beer, so the brewer is bound to speak highly of their own goods.  It turns out, I’m my own worst critic.  I’m constantly searching for ways to improve the beer.  Whenever I shared brews with others, they always liked it as well, but who doesn’t like free beer?  For me, the seed was planted quite a few years ago when I started winning homebrewing awards statewide.  It was then I began to realize that I was making more than just pretty good homebrew.  I was making some damn good beer!  I began volunteering to judge at homebrew competitions and making an effort to get out and sample more of the beers not available in northern Minnesota.  I quickly realized that there was much more to explore in the world of beer than I realized.  I studied and tasted everything I could find regarding brewing science and beer styles.  In the midst of all of the studying and research, I took the Beer Judge Certification Program test and obtained a National rank in the BJCP.  I now had some credentials to back up my knowledge of good beer and brewing.  It was clear that this was starting to become more than just a hobby, so I began to put a bit more time and effort into the dream of starting a brewery.    So, after all this research and planning, what’s the plan?  Start small.    Jack Pine Brewery is starting very small.  Nanobrewery small.  Brewing forty gallons at a time small.  Did I mention the brewer is small?    This little brewery serves as a pilot system for the eventual build-out of a full scale production brewery.  It provides the opportunity to test the waters before sinking a boatload of cash into a warehouse full of stainless equipment.  Best of all, it gives YOU a chance to TRY THE BEER!  I’ve been my own worst critic for the past 12 years of homebrewing.  Now it’s your turn.  With your help, we can build a brewery to provide our friends and neighbors with delicious locally-brewed beer.    So, stop in and give it a try!",http://jackpinebrewery.com/,2012,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_6VMNdS-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_6VMNdS-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_6VMNdS-large.png,"7942 College Rd, Ste 115",Brainerd,Minnesota,56425,46.3447626,-94.2338287,(218) 270-8072,Friday 4-7pm  Saturday 4-7pm,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2013,

nCojAV,Jamesport Brewing Company,"Jamesport Center is a late Victorian six storefront complex. The earliest section was completed in 1890 and was occupied by the Red Andrews Saloon and the Central House Hotel. It was built by August Tiedemann, a noted local builder and architect, for two Swedish brothers, ""Red"" Andrew Johnson and Axel Johnson. It largely served sailors of the Great Lakes during the booming days of logging in Western Michigan.  In 1892 a second structure with decorative cast iron columns was added.(Now, entrance to Sunset Bay Antiques.)

I ""bottled"" this first batch in pint-sized canning jars and judged when the natural carbonation had taken place by the ""plink, plink"" noises of the lids buckling upward under pressure. Friends suggested names for my first brew, and a couple stand out in my mind: ""Junk's Trunk"" and ""Junkyard"" beer.

1xeovq,Lucid Brewing,"In July 2010, over a craft beer at a local restaurant, Eric Biermann and Jon Messier had a Lucid thought – “Let’s throw away the ties and the corporate ladders.  Let’s start a craft beer brewery!”  That Clarity in Thinking, led to the successful launch of Lucid Brewing.    In June of 2011, with a year of planning already completed, they realized jumping headfirst into the brewery was the only way they could make their dream a reality.  They quit their day jobs.      With that leap of faith – and a ton of support from many friends and family – they started building their brewery from the ground up.  Through the sweltering heat of the 2011 summer, many friends labored side by side with Jon and Eric.  They did it all, start to finish, from digging trenches to assembling the last tank.  So of course they needed a refreshing and light drink to quench their thirst while they toiled away.  They found just the right recipe and brewed their first beer – AIR.  A beer made to get the job done.  Its slight citrus aroma and flavor, lower ABV and crisp dry finish made this their favorite “go to” beer.      By October the brewery was complete and cooking.  And in the spirit of the season, Eric and Jon gave thanks to the Brew gods when they made their first deliveries to their first three customers the week of Thanksgiving… in Jon’s car.  Lucid was on its way!    Always keeping an eye on the demand for high quality while quickly catching the craft beer lover’s attention, Lucid assembled a team of dedicated employees and introduced brews to quench their customers’ demands.   AIR, DYNO, FOTO and DUO, along with seasonal and small-batch brews, are quickly becoming Minnesota favorites at local bars and restaurants.

qUIYuC,Lucky Town Brewing Company,"Living in Mississippi, the selection of beer has always been limited compared to the rest of the country – but that does not stop those of us who seek out the diverse supply of the world’s greatest beers. Some drive across state lines to acquire the finer choices at festivals and suppliers alike, while others exchange trades with those from other states in search of the locally forbidden. But for those who truly take matters into their own hands, homebrewing beer becomes the purest form of gratification.    Driven by an extreme passion for both innovation and beer, our Brewmaster took what was once just a dream and decided to create a beer that would not only break state laws but also help change the very same laws that Mississippi has let fall behind. For eight years, he brewed beers of many different styles as a hobby - and with each tasting that he would hold at his home, the crowds grew larger. Eventually, he would be convinced that this beer should be available to those patrons who also appreciate the finer beers of the world.    Lucky Town Brewing Company was founded on this very notion – to craft beers that break boundaries between the working men and women of Mississippi and their wish for locally produced premium beer. With that mission, Lucas Simmons decided to grant those wishes by sharing his passion for crafting beer in 2011.",http://www.luckytownbrewing.com,2011,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/84iCMX/upload_NKhh2n-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/84iCMX/upload_NKhh2n-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/84iCMX/upload_NKhh2n-large.png,1710 N Mill St,Jackson,Mississippi,39202,32.319632,-90.188048,(601) 201-0988,,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2011,

Krook's Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.    Four years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000, we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River. In 2003, we added a Stone Pizza Oven and a Sushi Bar to expand our menu selection.

We will fulfill all those same criteria.     Manor House Brewing represents an alternative to conventional beer, we are prideful in our local roots and want to inspire pride in our local community. Our beer is an output of a thoughtful creative process and we view what we do as art, not commodity. We experiment with new things, but try to predict the outcome in advance. Every so often, we accidentally stumble upon greatness.    Why do we want to brew beer? To satisfy a longing for the simple pleasures and a simpler time. Happiness, joy, and relaxation is our goal.    How are we different from every other craft brewer? The very same thing that makes us the same. We are creative, innovative and different.

With five generations of family lineage handcrafting beverages in South Dakota, and with 15 years as winemaker and owner of Prairie Berry Winery, Brewmaster Sandi Vojta is inspired by the traditional brewing styles of her family’s European heritage. By infusing regional and seasonal ingredients into the recipes handed down to her, she has skillfully adapted those traditional styles to create craft beers with a regional character, setting each distinctly apart from other microbrews.    All of our beers are produced in small, 15-barrel fermenters, allowing us to keep each batch small enough to maintain microbrew quality and a close attention to detail at all times. The results are craft beers that are approachable and distinctive, to be enjoyed by craft beer novices and enthusiasts alike.    We invite you to experience Miner Brewing for yourself, as we open our Tap Room in Hill City this fall 2013.

MBBC was started by two brewers whose quest for the perfect beer led them to learn the art of brewing.  Chris Hunt and Duncan Guy began their brewing education in the Barley Mob Brewers homebrewing club and continued to search for unique and distinctive ale and lager formulas. They decided to offer their creations to the public through a small batch microbrewery in 2006.  Soon thereafter, award-winning brewer Courtney Tyvand joined the two and presented his smoked porter at the brewery’s first beer dinner in October of 2006.    The brewery is located on the ground floor of a historic building at 4015 Tennessee Avenue in St. Elmo.  The building is constructed of foot-square cedar timbers and two-foot thick walls made of granite stone and mortar.  Built in 1911 as a packaging factory for K-Rations for WWI, we occasionally find artifacts from that era in the building walls and ceiling.  The brewery shares space with the Chattanooga U-Brew, a brew-on-premises business owned by Greg McCort.     MBBC is proud to offer small batch specialty ales and lagers in kegs of various sizes.  A tasting room is part of the brewery; samples of our beers can be tasted and tested on premises.  Occasionally we have tasting events or tapping events at the brewery or at a nearby bar or restaurant.  Please check our calendar for scheduled tasting events at the brewery.",http://www.bendbrewingbeer.com/,2006,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zpGIxB/upload_ywwMfl-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zpGIxB/upload_ywwMfl-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zpGIxB/upload_ywwMfl-large.png,4015 Tennessee Avenue,Chattanooga,Tennessee,37409,35.007563,-85.327766,423-821-6392,,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2006,

Alright, we don’t make the last one, but we COULD if we wanted to. We take pride in the freshness of our dough and veggies. Our dough was made today.

You’ll use them for about seven minutes and then we have to throw them away. It’s nothing personal. If you absolutely need one we’re happy to oblige, but we’re trying to reduce our non-recyclables, keep our landfills at a minimum, and keep plastic out of our oceans.

Are we trying to conserve ice bergs? Nope. We don’t even know any icebergs. Our soda’s are handmade with the finest extracts available, fantastic water and cane sugar. They’re served at cellar temps just like our beers, so you get a full flavored beverage that doesn’t need to be watered down.

DlWtXi,Thomas,"As Natives of West Virginia, it has long been our dream to bring quality hand-crafted beer back to our state.    Originally from Elkins and Helvetia, we were raised on easy drinking beers and homemade wine. Curiosity eventually got the best of us, and we combined the two - our first batch of homebrew was conceived in the early 90's with home brewing equipment, books, and some ingredients handed down from our parent's home brewing days in the 70's.    Since then we've learned a lot about brewing professionally. We developed easy drinking and well rounded beers with our own state of the art brewing equipment. We sold our first beer in October 2005 and now we're distributing throughout the Canaan Valley, Davis, Thomas, Elkins, Morgantown and Fayetteville.    That's our story so far. Thank you for all the great support we've received pursuing our dream.    - Brian & Willie",http://mountainstatebrewing.com/,2005,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yJVm42/upload_nsLEUB-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yJVm42/upload_nsLEUB-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/yJVm42/upload_nsLEUB-large.png,1 Nelson Boulevard,Thomas,West Virginia,26292,39.140863,-79.499701,304-463-4500,"Thur-Fri 6pm-12am,   Sat 3pm-12am",Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,,

Think of this as your own internet brewpub where you can sidle up next to the brewmaster and ask a question — because you can.    What’s so Mysterious?    It’s a bit of a throwback. “Mystery” in its original definition meant the “art and craft of a trade.”  Brewers were among the first organized trade groups; there is evidence of a guild of brewers as early as 12th Century London: “the Master, Keepers or Wardens and Commonalty of the Mistery or Art of Brewers of the City of London”.

I’m talking about 20 gallon batches here… one keg at a time. Brewing will take place 2 to 3 times a week. The Primary focus of the first year will be to develop a few finalized, tweaked, end game recipes that I can set as a standard at the pub. I want to continually narrow down the recipes and processes until I have taken them to where I would be confident in sharing them with the worlds best brewers. The secondary focus is to experiment with different styles of beer and explore the art of brewing. Ideally, I would like to brew 3 times a week.

R59V2j,Naked City Brewery & Taphouse,"Once upon a time, there were two dudes named Donald and Don. One was an engineer toiling away on the super computers of a local university, and the other was a supervisor managing the complex operations of a local billionaire. Both of them loved their jobs, but more than their jobs they loved beer. Each Don had a recurring dream of a magical place without a name, a place where the great beers of the world flowed like the Salmon le Sac at flood stage, and the fine brewing tradition of the Pacific Northwest stood proudly beside the best concoctions from far-flung breweries in Asia and across Europe.    Don and Donald worked tirelessly in the wee hours on their home brew mixtures, searching for the best possible combination of hops, malt, barley, and love. For long years, the two Dons had their separate dreams, and never met. A local poet named Bryan had the pleasure of growing up with Donald, and worked for the same local billionaire as Don. After many months of hearing Don speak of his dream of the magical beer haven, Bryan knew it must be the very same place of which Donald had spoken too. He knew instinctively that it was his responsibility to bring the two Dons together. On a fateful summer afternoon at the Elysian Brewery on Capitol Hill, the two Dons met. The event later became known as THE HAPPY HOUR OF DESTINY.    Every patron in the pub knew something special was happening that day. The magical place both men dreamed of was one and the same. That very afternoon, the two Dons vowed to create a great beer haven right here on earth, and together they would name this magic place THE NAKED CITY. In THE NAKED CITY, it doesn't matter where you're going or where you've been, all that matters is great living and great beer. In THE NAKED CITY, the only problem is what great craft beer to try next. The two Dons spent a combined 25 years studying the world's great brewing traditions, and couldn't wait to begin experimenting together. Their very first batch of beer, an Oak-aged double IPA, took a ribbon in the Northwest regionals of the 2007 National Homebrew Competition. The rest, as they say, is history.    Two years after the two Dons combined their separate dreams, THE NAKED CITY opened its doors. Now Naked City boasts an award-winning brewery that produces a variety of small-batch beers available at the pub and friendly bars and restaurants in Seattle, Tacoma, Bellingham, and beyond. The 24 taps of THE NAKED CITY offer a constantly rotating variety of Washington's best beers, regional craft beers, and the best beers Donald and Don have found in two lifetimes of beer travels around the world.    Two and a half years after THE NAKED CITY was founded, the Dons convinced the local poet who brought them together to join them in the adventure. The Dons and Bryan together built a bigger brewery; a full-size kitchen; a dining room/movie theatre called The Screening Room that features free monthly events including film, comedy, poetry, community discusssion, and jazz; and now The Walrus Beer Garden, a patio that's home to murals by local artists, games, and summertime events.

ZK7bhN,New American Brewing Co.,"Our story starts in the kitchen of David Bryan circa 2006.  That's when the first batches of home-brewed beer began appearing and David's wife Lori began to realize that her husband was forming a lifetime passion.

The history of small family owned breweries that we able to serve fresh handcrafted beer to their local communities.  The fact that the these small local breweries became points of pride in the community and that the businesses would stay in the family for generations.       An idea began to grow.  The idea that despite the brewing world we live in now with mega breweries pumping out mass marketed bland beer, that a small locally owned brewery making fresh unique beer could again be a source of pride for a community.  David dreamed of recreating this American brewing tradition and so set out on his way to do just that.     David spent the next 7 years honing his craft.  Learning about beer styles and brewing techniques.  Winning contests with his beer and defining a unique style for quality and consistency.  In 2012 the wheels were set into motion for our brewery when David met Tyler Meusburger, a colleague with a passion for entrepreneurship and creativity.  Working together they began building a business plan and putting financing into place, and in Nov of 2013 David and Tyler brewed the first batch of beer at New American Brewing Co.

The brewery opened up two locations statewide with bistros serving their craft beer and an extensive menu including burgers, brewpub food & wood-fired pizzas. Nimbus beer is renowned throughout the state for its collection of natural beers that derive from the local Tucson groundwater that resembles that of the water found on the Burton in the heart of England. It is that exceptional water that makes their flagship beer, Old Monkey Shine a favorite of true beer enthusiasts. This traditional English Strong Ale is a medium-bodied ale with a dark, roasted flavor derived from seven different malts and brown sugar. This dark beer starts with a touch of sweetness but finishes dry and crisp.

KzHweV,Ninkasi Brewing Company,"In late 2005, Nikos Ridge and Jamie Floyd met at a favorite local bottle  shop in Eugene, Ore. Nikos was sampling a beer Jamie had brewed at a local  restaurant/brewery and through mutual friends, the two started talking.  The conversation landed on the question, “What would you do if you could  open your own brewery?” With Nikos’ background in finance and Jamie’s  experience in brewing, it seemed like a good skillset for starting a brewery.  The two began brewing about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when  Nikos and Jamie spent 17 hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination  IPA. The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German  restaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped  with a 15-barrel brew house. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one  soul driving purpose—through the creation of the highest quality beers;  to improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its  employees, and business partners.    Both founders knew they wanted to do things differently—within the beer  industry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape  was home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company  that represented what beer meant to them—a source of community and  the root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi—the Sumerian goddess of  fermentation—was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer  not only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but  was also the center of community and culture, one never in operation  without the other—a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to  find property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real  estate in Eugene’s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its  current location in 2007.  Since then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to produce more  beer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility,  tasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the  focus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi’s culture continues to embody  “Believe in the Goddess”—symbolizing the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated  human experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer.  The current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system, with a capacity of  95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska,  California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.  The Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series, has grown from  its first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA,  Believer Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout,  and Quantum Pale Ale. Today, the Ninkasi family of brands includes its  Flagship, Seasonal Release, Special Release, Prismatic Lager, Single Hop,  and R&D Series.",http://www.ninkasibrewing.com/,2006,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-large.png,272 Van Buren St,Eugene,Oregon,97402,44.056855,-123.10988,877-7-NINKASI,,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2006,

The youngest of six in a family of caterers, he may have it in his genes to provide others with food and drink, and the early experiments proved a hit at weekly parties on Missoula's University Avenue. Dan tried his hand at the homebrew standards--stouts, porters, English-style ales, etc.--but also made a mean hefeweizen (no lemon, please), alt, marzen, dunkel, and other Continental styles. Since moving to Portland in 2001, he's quenched the thirst of friends, neighbors and guests--not just college partygoers but beer geeks who live in Beervana for a reason.

oPxIne,Ocelot Brewing Company,"Craft beer is a passion, an obsession and a journey. This journey has opened our eyes (and taste buds) to some of the finest examples of beer this planet has to offer. Our tastes and expectations have forever changed, and so have our methods of enjoyment. From beer trades, to home brewing, to attending release parties and festivals one thing became clear… We rarely drink the same beer over and over again, and we love to share.    Our IPAs will be constantly revolving depending on inspiration, hop variety, availability, and season. We will make everything from low gravity Sessions, to Regulars, Doubles, Triples and even a San Diego Pale Ale or two. We will make sure these styles are released, distributed, and tapped… FRESH!    We like big beers and we cannot lie! From the biggest Russian Imperial Stouts aged in spirit barrels to malty Double Reds, Smooth Porters, and velvety Wee Heavies, we just can’t get enough of these complex beauties. Thick mouthfeel, high gravity, and rich flavors suitable for aging to be shared with family and friends. Crack one open to celebrate a special occasion, or just because its a Tuesday.    Mouth puckering sour ales is another style which we adore. One which we hoard, savor, and curse for not being more readily available. Using wine barrels from local Virginia Wineries we will age some carefully crafted super tart ales, blending them when needed and using fruits for character. Once the bugs catch up to our pipeline, expect a new sour to be released every month.    At Ocelot, we love two things… Beer and Music!    We believe in inspiration. It can come in many forms and varies from person to person. For us, music has always been our inspiration. Music has been the soundtrack to our lives and has in one way or another crafted every decision we’ve made. We aim to create and dedicate our beers to the music that has inspired our journey through life.    Ocelot Brewing Company is a reflection of us, our styles, and our habits. From chasing freshies to cellaring whales and everything in between. We will craft many different beers in small batches. We brew beer we want to drink when we want to drink it.

We set sail in December 2009, during the height of a global economic storm, and have quickly become one of the fastest growing breweries in Washington, with our beer is now sacking and pillaging cities throughout Washington and British Columbia. We have taken a different tack than many new brewers, and rather than going for a number of very big, single batch beers, we are focused on food-friendly beers in a smaller lineup that is readily available year round. We realized a long time ago that food-friendly by no means needs to be less flavorful, and we actually add ingredients to widen the palate of our beers above and beyond their original styles.    To better integrate with a meal and make our beers more ‘sessionable’ in general, we utilize highly attenuating yeasts to dry out our beers to make them less sweet and filling, then replace that desired sweetness with an addition outside the norm, such as Juniper, Ginger or even Angelica. These ingredients are always kept at a level to avoid building a ‘spice beer’, and always present themselves as a unique and complementary addition. We also focus on extremely clean finishes, and use the entire recipe to build bittering rather than just using the hops to reduce lingering starchiness.    In the end, the true beauty of any flavor is in the eye (and mouth) of the beholder. Read about our beers here, then taste them at your local restaurant or store and judge for yourself if we have truly crafted ‘Great Beer Designed With Great Food In Mind’.

I4hZZy,Odyssey Beerwerks,"Back when the world was a much different place, filled with grunge music, loose fitting clothes, and Wayne’s World movies, two shady characters fell in together and started doing various sketch and wonderful things. One of these was brewing . . . beer. Not the tasty, modern, complex craft beers flowing in today’s market, but the goofy and “just OK” beers that home brewers in the 90’s seemed to know how to build. These guys (we’ll call them Chris and Josh for lack of anonymity’s sake) got better at brewing over the years, even as they moved apart.    Chris went down a corporate marketing path; Josh seemed to prefer engineering and operations; both still enjoyed beer and, with lots of practice, the homebrew got better and better. When Y2K sputtered out before it even came to life, the two had their first discussion about opening a brewery. More life happened. More of the guys’ improving craft beers were served at more home parties. When they got together again more recently, the topic resurfaced, but this time it wouldn’t go away. And gradually a brewery was born.    20 years since the start of their homebrew hobbies, Odyssey Beerwerks was formed to do the impossible: take an enjoyable hobby of creating fine craft beers and make it into a dreary job, with the benefit of bringing new and exciting hand crafted beers onto our vibrant planet.",http://www.odysseybeerwerks.com/,2011,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zMORP4/upload_73PUUD-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zMORP4/upload_73PUUD-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zMORP4/upload_73PUUD-large.png,"5535 W 56th Ave,",Arvada,Colorado,80002,39.8007911,-105.0589359,(303) 421-0772,M-Th 3-9  F-Sa 2-10  Su Noon-7,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2011,

At Old Forge Brewing Company, we strive to honor personal craftsmanship. Our hand-crafted beer is made in small batches to ensure quality and peak freshness, while the healthy and delicious menu has ingredients sourced from local farms and markets wherever possible.

Xz6lr3,Our Mutual Friend Malt & Brew,"Our Mutual Friend is a brewery and taproom located in the Five Points neighborhood of Denver. For us, brewing beer began as an excuse to gather with our friends and ruminate on life, philosophy, music, food, and of course, beer. Once we got started, we grew more curious about the brewing process, honing our craft and experimenting with different methods and techniques. Along the way a fundamental question to our process was, how can we do more of this ourselves? Our desire to participate in every step of the grain to glass process led us to open Our Mutual Friend.    At OMF, our goal is to use local sources to brew local ales. This is why we malt and roast as much of the grain we use in our beer as we can. As a small maltstery, we have more influence over the quality and freshness of the beers we pour in our taproom, and more opportunities to source our ingredients locally. 100 percent of our barley is grown right here in Colorado. And as much as possible, we source our hops and specialty ingredients from farms in our state.     Part of what we love about beer is its power to bring people together (hence our name!). We’re excited to be a gathering place in the Five Points neighborhood where locals and visitors alike can meet in camaraderie alongside a quality pint of ale. We believe in the power of neighborly acts and the spirit of neighbors taking care of one another within the local community. We at OMF support and strive for the Denver community to know each other better and enjoy a good pint in the same process.     We are excited to see our city developing a local, world-class brewery community, and look forward to building relationships with our friends and neighbors, and collaborating with other breweries to cherish our Denver home and protect our collective local influence.",http://www.omfmb.com/,2012,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Ij1ASf/upload_nGDJ35-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Ij1ASf/upload_nGDJ35-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Ij1ASf/upload_nGDJ35-large.png,2810 Larimer Street,Denver,Colorado,80205,39.760595,-104.982712,(720) 722-2810,Thu: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm  Fri: 4:00 pm - 12:00 am  Sat: 2:00 pm - 12:00 am  Sun: 2:00 pm - 10:00 pm,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2012,

A6u3vC,Brewery & Pub,"We are a very small-scale brewery and pub specializing in foreign and unique beers and eats.  Our brewery is a 1 barrel system (two kegs) which we use to create hand-crafted, more often than not, specialty ales.  Our brewery is based around experimentation, so our taps change frequently.  We usually do not brew the same beer twice, but will do so if enough people ask.    By definition, an outlander is a stranger, a foreigner, but here he is much more. This is how we see him: The outlander is the innovator; he is the one who drives change. It is the outlander, whether in mind or origin, who represents the ambitious, passionate pioneer who is willing to put everything on the line in order to make his dream come true. It’s often a simple dream, a dream to share his knowledge, his expertise with the ones who call him stranger. And certainly the public may reject his ideas, they may cast him back to where he came from. But does this ever worry the outlander? Never. Because the outlander believes in his ideas. He knows what he is offering is great and he knows others, once they put aside their prejudice, will know this too. He knows that someone who has invested their time, their life, their hopes and dreams behind something cannot fail.

NkKRig,Pig's Eye Brewing Company,"Pig's Eye Brewing Company was established in 2002.  The previous owner of the Pig's Eye brands, Minnesota Brewing Company, had gone out of business in June of that year.  We (two former Minnesota Brewing Company employees - Phil Gagne', the Brewmaster, and Jeff Crawford, the VP of Sales) formed Pig's Eye Brewing Company, and purchased the Pig's Eye brands from ... Minnesota Brewing company's creditors in September 2002.     With the old brewery closed, and  limited resources at our disposal, we applied for, and received, permission from the Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau to brew as an ""alternating proprietor"" at City Brewing Company - La Crosse, WI; a brewery with a longstanding brewing heritage, and a commitment to quality.  As an ""alternating proprietor"", we are a ""brewery within a brewery"", essentially renting brewing and packaging equipment from City whenever we are brewing and packaging our products.    Our inaugural brews of Pig's Eye Pilsner and Pig's Eye Light were started on February 18, 2003, with the 1st product run was on March 25, 2003.  To the chagrin of some of our loyal customers, we made the decision to drop the ""Pirate"" rendering of ""Pig's Eye"" from our packaging, in favor of a historically accurate portrayal of Pierre ""Pig's Eye"" Parrant.  In May 2004, in response to consumer interest in low-carb products, we replaced Pig's Eye Light with Pig's Eye Lean Light (the original Pig's Eye light beer).  Our product line expanded again in January 2006 - with the introduction of Pit Bull High Gravity Ice Malt Liquor, and again in June 2007 - with the re-introduction of Pig's Eye Ice.  We  also, for a short period of time, operated as an alternating proprietorship and packaged 24/12 Returnable Bottles at Stevens Point Brewery- Stevens Point, WI, but had to discontinue the production of the returnable bottle package due to increases in packaging costs.

EhUsAz,Pine Street Brewery,"When asked, “Why we started brewing?” The common response back in 2009 was, “We like arts and crafts”. The brewing began in a small apartment kitchen on Pine St. in San Francisco on a stove that could hardly generate a boil. During the first night, it became apparent that we could create the beer that we wanted to drink and the collective that became Pine Street Brewery (PSB) was born. That was goal from the first night of brewing—it was love at first smell.    PSB moved into the historic Bourne Mansion in Pacific Heights during the Spring of 2010 and called this home until the Fall of 2011. Regular weekly brewing led to lots of experimentation and ten recipes that have become part of the core beer list. During “Brew Nights,” friends were made, a community was fostered and a brand was started.    Pine Street Brewery was designed so that our products would be available for many different palates in many different communities. There is a unique Pine Street in almost every area. We intend for our beer, interpretations of classic styles, to unite people across the US, one beer at a time.    Our philosophy is to provide a celebration through ales and togetherness.

TKwUTr,Piney River Brewing Company,"Founded in 2010, Piney River Brewing Company is a microbrewery dedicated to making distinctive craft beers that celebrate life in the Ozarks. Joleen and Brian Durham, owners, have lived and farmed in Texas County for many years, and they have enjoyed craft beer for a long time, too.    Today, Joleen and Brian live up the hill from the Little Piney River that flows into the Big Piney.  They benefit from multiple fresh water springs and a waterfall on their farm, and they continually find themselves drawn to the rivers that flow around their farm and throughout the Ozarks.    Joleen and Brian first made beer on the kitchen stove, fermenting it in the basement of their 100-year old farm house.  In July 2010 they partnered together to revive a 70-year old barn made from red and white oak trees harvested off the farm, and Piney River Brewing Company was born.    The barn, rechristened BARn, is home to Piney River Brewing Company.  Joleen and Brian began the craft brewery as a “nanobrewery”, brewing on a 10-gallon Sabco system.

5efIdI,Pinnacle Peak Patio Steakhouse & Microbrewery,"When first opened in 1957, the Pinnacle Peak was a general store and rest stop for travelers heading to nearby lakes. To boost sales of his small business, the owner decided to serve dinner on the weekends. It was a great success - and the rest is restaurant history. What started as a weekend cookout has grown into the world's largest western steakhouse with seating for 1800 people inside and outside for 2000.    Pinnacle Peak Patio is renowned for its delicious mesquite broiled steaks, casual western atmosphere, and its ""NO NECKTIE POLICY."" This ""no necktie"" tradition was started one night when a Phoenix executive came in for dinner. The original owner, wanting to keep the atmosphere in his restaurant casual, told the executive, ""Either you take that tie off, or I'll cut it off."" The executive did not take heed and was appalled when the owner pulled out a butcher knife and promptly cut off the offending cravat.    Wanting to be recognized as a victim of this absurd policy, the executive demanded that his tie be prominently displayed for all to see. The necktie was stapled to the rafters along with a business card identifying its victim. Pinnacle Peak is very serious about its ""no necktie"" policy and has cut over a million ties from unsuspecting customers.",http://pppatio.com,,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Neba3O/upload_OLyV4w-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Neba3O/upload_OLyV4w-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Neba3O/upload_OLyV4w-large.png,10426 East Jomax Road,Scottsdale,Arizona,85255,33.7268223,-111.8531069,1-480-563-5133,,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,,

While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.     The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.

DrFlD0,Carlsbad,"Back in March of 1987 Gina and Vince Marsaglia, a pair of siblings in their 20?s, bought a struggling pizza place in the sleepy coastal town of Solana Beach, just north of San Diego. From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the “Pizza Port” with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own “San Diego” twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach    The parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge décor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn’t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite.     Early on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant’s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992.     Embracing the same “flavor-driven” principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego’s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival “Small Brewpub of the Year”.     The Pizza Port family’s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named “Large Brewpub of the Year”.",http://www.pizzaport.com/locations/carlsbad/,1987,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QSVVxD/upload_Yqeh6Z-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QSVVxD/upload_Yqeh6Z-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QSVVxD/upload_Yqeh6Z-large.png,571 Carlsbad Village Dr.,Carlsbad,California,92008,33.1596505,-117.3478111,760-720-7007,,N,N,N,Y,brewpub,Brewpub,US,United States,USA,1997,

84EPbp,Pleasure House Brewing,"In the 17th and 18th centuries, pubs were just as important for social as for practical reasons. People met in pubs to share stories, news, ideas, and company over their pints. Today’s craft brewing industry is increasingly local, providing a chance to renew the community gathering role that pubs played in our past.     To that end, we are using local talent in every aspect of our business, from spent grain to art to tap handles to logo and t-shirt design; we will also make every effort to promote other local breweries and businesses.    We will focus on producing small batches of technically-great, full-flavored ales that infuse pleasurable twists into classic styles… and sometimes blow style guidelines out of the water. It is also our intention to serve 4-5 categories of beer (I/IPA, Hoppy, Belgian, Malty, and Seasonal taps) but to continually rotate the specific beers served in each category so that we provide a new drinking pleasure on almost every visit.

HeStKS,Potosi Brewing Company,"Founded in 1852 by Gabriel Hail and John Albrecht, the Potosi Brewery began as a small brewery quenching the thirsts of area farmers, fishermen and miners. In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.    The restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.    In 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.",http://www.potosibrewery.com/,1852,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_DbScRK-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_DbScRK-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_DbScRK-large.png,209 South Main Street,Potosi,Wisconsin,53820,42.6716654,-90.7271709,608-763-4002,,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,1852,

WHuVdK,Prescott Brewing Company,"PBC is well-established and highly successful, with a history of annual growth since inception. We foster a team oriented management style. We offer an excellent casual, yet professional, dining experience for our guests, never pretentious, emphasizing ""fun & friendly... brewpub style"" menu selections and service. We are high-volume, fast paced and right in the middle of all the action for the dozens of events that take place right outside our doorstep on Prescott's hometown Courthouse Plaza. We are community minded and involved in many local events and fundraisers. Our kitchen is a 99% scratch kitchen, providing a large & varied menu. Our bar is lively and we attract people of all ages and backgrounds. We are hands-on owners and look for managers with the same philosophy.    We’re also pleased to announce that Prescott Brewing Company, the MICROBREWERY, is now an extension of our brewery operations!  With the introduction of PBC’s Liquid Amber Ale and Ponderosa IPA in cans, we quickly outgrew our little 7-barrel brewhouse that’s been our workhorse since opening in 1994.  So we bit the bullet and built an off-site microbrewery production plant out by the Prescott airport in 2011.  The first 30-barrel batch of Liquid Amber was brewed by John and Lead Brewer, Jan, on December 27th, 2011 and was a true better- late- than- never Christmas gift!  Look for both brands increasingly available throughout Arizona.  And thus the story continues.      PBC celebrated its 20TH ANNIVERSARY downtown Prescott in March of 2014….thanks to our many loyal supporters, locals and visitors alike. 20 years of hard labor...nah, not that bad, but 20 years in the restaurant business is a LONG time!  So, we’ll just keep on keepin’ on and are excited to expand the selection of canned product for distribution as production allows out at the airport location.    YOU are included amongst those who've allowed us to thrive, contribute to our community and keep 65-75 employees on staff all year long! As everyone knows, these have been difficult times for many. We believe every one of us knows personally of someone who has struggled these past few years with job loss, or a small business owner who has had to lay off a good employee, or maybe has had to close their business. Luckily, PBC is okay, thanks to YOU. Not to say we wouldn’t want more of the dining dollars out there...but we’re extremely grateful for the continued support of those in our community and visitors from literally all over the world. We’d like to remind everyone that each of us can make a difference in our communities by shopping local, supporting locally-owned, independent businesses, supporting our local charities and non-profits and volunteering for our favorite causes. Prescott is an amazing community...let’s keep it that way! THANKS A BUNCH!

e0v4NA,Public House Brewing Co,"In 2010, Josh & Beth Stacy and Josh & Trisha Goodridge--longtime  friends--opened Public House Brewing Company in Rolla, MO, the town's first brewpub.  But it was a long, long time in the works.  Like any business, there were big ups and downs on the road to the first pour and we think that story is worth sharing.  So here goes....     Josh Stacy grew up like any other kid in America, playing music, sports, and sharing his space with two siblings.  Totally normal--with one exception.  His father, Steven Stacy, was an award-winning home brewer.  Steve was brewing world class beers in his kitchen before most people had even heard of the hobby.  Josh grew up thinking every kid helped their dad bottle homemade beer on Saturday mornings before they could watch cartoons.     Fast-forward a few years.  Stacy and Goodridge meet in junior high, become fast friends, and begin playing music together (and have been ever since).  Even more years went by.  Between the two there were graduations, marriages, children, careers, and beer.  Yes, beer.  At some point (memories are fuzzy) Stacy introduced Goodridge to drinking real, full-flavored craft beers.  It wasn't long before he introduced Goodridge to brewing real, full-flavored craft beers.  Goodridge was hooked.      Many weekends were spent in the Stacy home garage milling grain, mashing in, adding hops, and pitching yeast.  The two took in as much of Steve Stacy's brewing knowledge as possible, brewing good beer and having a couple pints throughout the brew day.  That always loosened the tongue.  Next would inevitably come the conversation about taking this hobby to the next level.      Goodridge heard this conversation more times than he can remember.  On a Sunday afternoon while leisurely enjoying a fine craft beer at home with his wife Trisha, he got a wild idea.  Enough was enough, he told her.  He immediately called Stacy and said, ""I'm coming over to your house.""  Goodridge passionately pleaded his case to Josh and Beth.  ""Rolla needs fresh craft beer and we're the guys for the job.""     Josh Stacy wasn't a hard sell as he had always truly wanted to do this, but now they needed help from their wives to make this dream happen.  Thankfully, these wonderful ladies agreed to take the plunge and the four embarked on the treacherous journey together to bring fresh craft beer to Rolla.  Many trials and triumphs later, Public House Brewing Company opened its doors on December 16th, 2010, to a very thirsty populous.     One week later, all the beer they had made was gone.  It was  a hit!  The Rolla area embraced its first and only craft brewpub and put Public House on the map.  Now the Stacys and Goodridges are fulfilling their dream of bringing hand-crafted beers of the highest quality to Mid-Missouri.  You are invited to come in and have a pint with us.  Cheers!     Now that you know our story, we encourage you to come in and share yours. No matter what the occasion, visiting The Public House Brewery is always an extraordinary experience.

qZJOHj,Quaff On! Brewing Company,"Quaff: To drink heartily and with gusto!    At Quaff ON! Brewing Company, 'Gusto' is part of everything we do. Our hand-crafted beers reflect our passion for the brewer's art and our commitment to creating beers that excite and delight the quaffer's palette.  Quaff ON! Brewing Company was formed in 2012 in response to the demand for the iconic craft beers we developed at Big Woods Brewing Company, our brewpub located in the heart of Brown County Indiana. Why 'Quaff ON!'? Because from the day Big Woods threw open its doors in 2009, Quaff ON! has been the rallying cry, the toast, and the salutation of our loyal fans.  When Big Woods founders Jeff McCabe, Tim O'Bryan and Ed Ryan decided to create Quaff ON! Brewing Company, they had one Master Brewer in mind to take Busted Knuckle Ale, Hare Trigger IPA, Six Foot Blonde and Timid Virgin Pale to new heights and a larger market. That Brewer is Mark Havens, whose reputation as a talented and committed 'creator of craft beers' is well known. Mark came on board in time to lend a hand in the conversion of our 60 year old bowling alley into the Quaff ON! brewing facility.  Once Mark got the new brewery up and running and our original Big Woods recipes were in production, Mark began introducing new beers, including Yellow Dwarf Wheat, a hopped up wheat that begs to be quaffed and Sadie the Goat Brown Ale, a hearty homage to the substantial beers quaffed by river pirates 2 centuries ago.  Currently Quaff ON!'s beers are distributed all over Indiana. Look for us at your favorite watering hole and in the craft beer section at package stores throughout the state. If Quaff ON! is not served at your favorite place, send us a note and we'll get it in there! If you're travelling our way, stop in and see us in Brown County and visit us in Nashville at Big Woods Village where you can enjoy fine craft beer, great food and the best in local entertainment.

Once the business was formed, a brewery name was needed.  After weeks of brainstorming, the name ‘Quest’ rose to the top of our list.  We wanted a name that emulates that passionate and adventurous spirit of the Greenville community.    ”People in Greenville are always on some kind of quest.  Whether it is to bike the entire Swamp Rabbit Trail or hike Table Rock, there is a very adventurous spirit here.  We wanted to embrace that.” -Quest’s Andrew Watts    Quest’s beer is meant to be premium and sought-after, much like a goal or quest.

vbKhpV,Redstone Meadery,"David Myers, known as 'Chairman of the Mead', founder of Redstone Meadery, is a romantic and wants to see mead once again enjoying the glory days of yesteryear. He started the Boulder, Colorado company with the 'natural philosophy' that he produce the highest quality honey wine on the market.    Because of this 'philosophy of mead', Redstone does not cork (to avoid oxidation) but instead uses swing top bottles. This ensures the mead will not breathe while cellaring plus offers a much longer shelf life once the bottle has been opened.    In keeping with the 'natural' approach, Redstone does not add any sulfites, a known allergen, as honey is it's own natural preservative. Redstone only pasteurizes the must (unfermented mead) and never boils. The company strives to feature the flavors of the fermentable as much as possible.    In 2003 Redstone Meadery brought the International Mead Festival (www.meadfest.com) to Boulder, Colorado and with that helped to establish mead as its own beverage category. Also at this time Redstone spearheaded the creation of the International Mead Association (www.meadfest.org) to help promote and educate the masses about the world's first fermented beverage.    Currently, Redstone products are distributed to 20 states across the U.S., making it the widest distributed wine from the state of Colorado and one of the most widely distributed meads in the country!

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence.

A microbrewery was in the original plans for the business but was not feasible at the time due to the high cost of equipment and space.  The Wildflower Café had enormous success, which helped the inspiration for the Crooked Rooster Brewpub’s opening in 1998, again founded by Doug Thayer.  Throughout the running of these side-by-side businesses, Doug always had brewing on his mind and began to experiment in 2002 with home brewing.  Receiving excellent feedback on his brews from several beer aficionados, Roosterfish Brewing’s first official beer, Black Walnut Nut Brown Ale (now known as Original Nut Brown Ale) was unveiled at the Crooked Rooster and Wildflower Café in 2004.  This was shortly followed with the Butternut Pale Ale, now known as Dog Tooth Pale Ale.  The drastic name changes occurred because the originals were rejected due to “implied ingredients” that weren’t actually present in the beers.",http://www.roosterfishbrewing.com/,1990,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WQyasy/upload_XoXYMd-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WQyasy/upload_XoXYMd-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WQyasy/upload_XoXYMd-large.png,223 - 301 North Franklin Street,Watkins Glen,New York,14891,42.381121,-76.874257,607-535-9797,Mon - Sun: 11:30 am - 12:30 am,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,1990,

N39Q0L,Rubicon Brewing Company,"For 22 years, the Rubicon Brewing Company has been a jewel of a capital city culture. It’s not just because of the award-winning fine ales and great food served up by the Rubicon. Within the past four years, under the auspices of owner Glynn Phillips, the Rubicon has become renowned for its community outreach and philanthropic efforts. It’s support for Sacramento kids and various people in need that has transformed the Rubicon into a vital cog of Sacramento life.    “This pub is part of the community, and I don’t just mean geographically,” said Glynn Phillips, owner of the Rubicon since June 2005. “It’s important for us to give back as much as we can to show our appreciation. I really feel like we’re connected with the people and that they can trust that they’ll feel at home here.”    Brewmaster Scott Cramlet has felt so at home that he’s stayed more than two decades. In October 2006, he experienced a thrill very few craft brewers achieve in their careers: stepping on stage to receive a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival. Cramlet won for his Winter Wheatwine, and followed that achievement with a silver GABF medal in 2009. In the craft brewing industry, consistent victories in the respected blind-panel tasting contest bring international acclaim.    “We’ve gone through so many different phases during my time here, but we’re very happy with things right now,” he said. “There is a lot of hope for future and expanding our business. We hope to double our capacity and get more of our products in bottles and more of a market presence -- not too huge but bigger than we are now. I’m certainly very proud to work for a place that has been around so long and has its place in history. We are not the new kid on street. I tell people how long I’ve been at the Rubicon, and I hear people say, ‘Wow, that’s impressive.’”    In some ways, the transition from founder Ed Brown to Phillips was more than a decade in the making. Brown had known Phillips since the 1970s as the good friend of Brown’s nephews in the Bay Area town of Moraga. As Phillips paid his dues in the craft brewing industry – first at Great Basin Brewing in Sparks, Nev., and next at Marin Brewing in Larkspur – Phillips kept in close contact with Brown. Buoyed by his management experience at Marin Brewing, Phillips was confident that he could handle the passing of the baton at the Rubicon.",http://www.rubiconbrewing.com/,1987,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iBzEfC/upload_9rcK7S-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iBzEfC/upload_9rcK7S-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iBzEfC/upload_9rcK7S-large.png,2004 Capitol Avenue,Sacramento,California,95814,38.573116,-121.480958,916-448-7032,Monday - Thrusday: 11am to 11:30pm  Friday & Saturday: 11am to 12:30am  Sunday: 11am to 10pm,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,1987,

hHD54O,Rush River Brewing,"Rush River Brewing Company  in River Falls, WI provides locally brewed ales throughout Wisconsin and Minnesota. Owner/Brewers Nick Anderson and Dan Chang started the company in 2004 with the help of a third partner, Robbie Stair after relocating to Minneapolis from Seattle. Robbie owned a farm in scenic Maiden Rock, WI just above the confluence of the Rush River and Lake Pepin. After converting a pole barn into a fully functioning brewery, the trio produced a limited quantity of draft-only beers while steadily building a reputation  for brewing high quality ales. After two and a half years of growth, it became evident that bottled beer was the next move to be made. Luckily, the town of River Falls, WI came to the table with an offer to build a custom building for a brand new brewery. In 2007, the new facility opened its doors with the addition of a refurbished bottling line, and additional fermenters.

Our small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.    We brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.    Our first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle.

Erika and Jeff were friends in early college years who found each other later, dated, got married, started a family, then asked each other, “What do you really want to do in life…(when you grow up)?”  They liked beer, liked making beer, liked having a good time, and liked sharing their likes with others.    Their first homebrew settings were humble: Jeff’s nose sticking deep into a carboy of fermenting beer in a friend's small apartment.    They evolved from the stove top with extract batches, to setting up a small, all-grain batch brewery (8 gallon kettles - Thanksgiving turkey frying pots -  on propane burners with converted coolers for mash tuns) on the back porch,  to bigger and bigger goals.  From a 5 gallon pot on the stove (with a batch of extract syrup), to a 10 gallon converted cooler (with cracked grain), and kegs turned to kettles, to working on a 15 barrel brewery creating batches that go state to state, national, international...  They made batches at home for themselves, their friends, for weddings, parties, etc..  and realized this is what they wanted to do for a job.   Jeff apprenticed with a professional brewer (local celebrity Skip Madsen of Pike, Boundary Bay, American, etc…) and learned the pro angle of the trade.   They have seen the evolution, gone through it, appreciate it, and are happy to be where they are today.    Salish Sea Brewing Co. is a 10 bbl (310 gallon per batch) establishment.  We hope to brew twice a week, offering a variety of ales and the occasional lager and pilsner.     Jeff and Erika have a  6-year-old little girl and a 2-year-old son.

TSKxwK,Sand Creek Brewing Company,"The Sand Creek Brewing Company began on a dairy farm in Downing, Wisconsin, about 20 miles northwest of the city of Menomonie. After homebrewing on the family farm for years, brewmaster Cory Schroeder teamed up with Jim Wiesender to found the brewery in 1999.    Using equipment scrounged from various industries, such as a converted pudding tank for the brew kettle, the pair launched a successful business, brewing the beer just steps away from the chicken coop and a busy dairy farm.    Their Sand Creek Golden Ale and English Style Special Ale, available only on draft and in half-gallon growlers, soon developed a reputation throughout Wisconsin's many brew fests. With a capacity of only about 150 barrels per year, the brewery, now with a third owner on board, quickly outgrew the little farm shed converted into a brewhouse.    Hoping to remain in the Dunn/St. Croix counties area, the company looked for a suitable place to relocate, but came up empty handed. Then opportunity knocked in the form of a phone call one evening from their friend in Black River Falls, Pioneer brewmaster Todd Krueger. The brewery was for sale.    In March of 2004 the combined forces of the two breweries officially formed the new Sand Creek Brewing Co. of Black River Falls, Wisconsin.",http://www.sandcreekbrewing.com/,1999,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gsADrL/upload_29jbgo-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gsADrL/upload_29jbgo-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gsADrL/upload_29jbgo-large.png,320 Pierce St,Black River Falls,Wisconsin,54615,44.2928569,-90.8510691,(715) 284-7553,,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,,

l2kbOf,Seven Brides Brewery,"Silverton, Oregon has much to offer. Known for its beautiful landscape of Silver Falls State Park and home of the Oregon Garden, it is rich with color and flavor. The town is lined with antique and coffee shops, restaurants and murals, but no micro-breweries, until now.    Seven Brides Brewing is changing that!    Several years ago, three dads and two uncles would gather on a Saturday in one of their garages to master the art of home brew. Before long, the salesman of the group said, “You know, this is good enough to sell.” So the friends set out to do just that.    The name “Seven Brides” actually came from the dads’ kids. Between three of them, they have seven daughters. With the rising cost of wedding nuptials, the guys decided they needed to sell enough beer to pay for their daughters weddings. Each of the girls has a beer named after her.",http://sevenbridesbrewing.com/,,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/preZog/upload_EzrQaS-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/preZog/upload_EzrQaS-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/preZog/upload_EzrQaS-large.png,990 N.

CzopCY,Short's Brewing Company,"In April of 2004 we opened the doors to Short’s Brewing Company in the quaint Village of Bellaire.  Beer was the mission, and liberation was the movement.  With a lot of elbow grease, blind ambition and a little luck, the quest to create a community pub in Northwest Lower Michigan began to take shape.  The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.    Today Short’s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.

Further releases have included the 12 oz Resin and 3Beans, as well as 16oz seasonal offerings such as Apollo and Autumnation.",http://www.sixpointcraftales.com/,2004,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7VPQrN/upload_X4w8Lq-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7VPQrN/upload_X4w8Lq-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7VPQrN/upload_X4w8Lq-large.png,40 Van Dyke St,Brooklyn,New York,11231,40.6739317,-74.0119473,917-696-0438,,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2005,

HGbr9s,Skagway Brewing Company,"With roots dating back to the Klondike Gold Rush of 1898, the Skagway Brewing Company first opened its doors in 1897 to serve the thirsty prospectors who had abandoned everything to head North and strike it rich in the gold fields. During its heyday, the Skagway Brewing Company and its brew master Herman Barthel, the most technologically adorned brewer on the West coast, produced up to 30,000 barrels of beer per year and had a bottling operation on site. Multiple breweries operated out of Skagway during the peak of the Gold Rush and by 1900 competition was fierce amongst them. With the Skagway economy on a decline due to the fervor of the gold rush ending and growing prohibition support, the Skagway Brewing Company closed its doors in 1904. In 1916, the “Alaska Bone Dry Law” was passed effectively ending the making and consumption of alcoholic beverages in the Territory of Alaska.    In 1997, a local entrepreneur reopened the Skagway Brewing Co. in the Golden North Hotel until 2002 when it again ceased operations. With the brewing tanks collecting dust and locals thirsty for microbrews, South Dakota native and long time Skagway resident, Michael Healy spotted an opportunity and bought the equipment in 2007. Operating in a brand new building, the Skagway Brewing Company again fired up the brew tanks and on July 4th, 2007 opened its doors once again much to the pleasure of locals and visitors alike. This bustling business keeps growing, frantically brewing to keep up with the high demand of its brews and quality-dining menu.

kXV5lc,Skull Coast Ales,"Incorporated in December 2011, the Skull Coast Brewing Company, Inc., is a new entity formed for the express purpose of brewing and distributing handcrafted artisan ales, and whose history has yet to be written. Prior to its formation, Dave Fox launched and operated the Skull Coast Ale Company, a limited liability company (LLC.), located in Fort Mill, South Carolina, organized in 2009. Without the investment dollars needed to start his own brewery, the Skull Coast Ale Company operated as a “Contract Brewing” or “Beer Marketing” company, in craft beer terms. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, the company contracted with other breweries to produce its beer recipes, and marketed the products under the Skull Coast name.    After months of recipe development and searching for a brewery to contract with, Dave Fox brewed Skull Coast's first beer on St. Patrick's Day, 2010, in Virginia. The result was Maelstrom IPA; a true west coast style India Pale Ale, aggressively hopped with seven different Northwest hops. After months of traveling back and forth between South Carolina and Virginia to brew and transport kegs (roughly seven hours each way), Dave sought out a second contract brewing relationship closer to home. Unfortunately, every Carolina brewery Dave approached was at or near capacity. Undeterred, Dave created his own capacity. In the first of its kind contract model, Dave purchased his own 60bbl fermenter and bright tanks, and placed them in another brewery.    The Skull Coast Brewing Company is the continuation of a lifelong dream. The brand was born in a small Charleston library after looking at a local map drawn in the 1700's, during the Golden Age of Piracy, with the words ""Skull Coast"" etched along the Carolina coastline. The Skull Coast products matured and our understanding of the beer business was developed during our contract brewing experience, under the Skull Coast Ale Company. Now, with a new entity, our own facility and unrestricted in our growth, the Skull Coast Brewing Company hopes to become a lifelong part of your history.",http://skullcoastales.com/,2011,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_8OZR9o-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_8OZR9o-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_8OZR9o-large.png,802 Somerton Drive,Fort Mill,South Carolina,29715,35.011366,-80.956275,803-619-9295,,N,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,,

They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States.

nwNOxm,Spiteful Brewing,"Spiteful Brewing was founded in January 2010 by Brad Shaffer and Jason Klein. While the brewery is new, we have known each other since we were kids. It was a friendship that started instantly following a spiteful incident during a hockey game on the pond. Initially home brewing in the kitchen on a stove, we’ve slowly upgraded our system as we gained experience and understanding of the brewing process. We now have a Brew-Magic system by Sabco, which is a 13 gallon semi automated pilot brewery.     As a nanobrewery our goal is to supply a few great bars in Chicago with kegs that we will hand deliver. Our beers are made with the freshest malts, hops, and yeast purchased locally. This provides much more flavor compared to typical light beer massed produced today. We have moved into our new commercial space located just south of the Ravenswood neighborhood and have approval from the federal government. We are currently working towards our state permits.",http://spitefulbrewing.com/,2010,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qlwwem/upload_jTJlM5-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qlwwem/upload_jTJlM5-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qlwwem/upload_jTJlM5-large.png,1815 W.

Saint Boniface is the name of the patron saint of brewers, the saint also associated with converting Germany to Christianity. St. Boniface saw the unconverted Saxons worshiping Thor and knew something must be done. The humble saint took an axe to the massive Thor Oak, which was sacred to the Saxons, in order to show them that his God was mightier than theirs. With fierce and repeated blows he leveled the massive tree; those around him feared God and were converted to Christianity.    The deed of Boniface provides an elegant analogy for our own mission at Saint Boniface Craft Brewing Co.

HZvqhd,Starr Hill Brewery,"In the mid-90’s, Master Brewer Mark Thompson returned to his native Virginia from Portland, OR, having learned two things: first, that the craft of artisanal brewing was one part science and one part art; and second, that making delicious beer was a lot cooler than anything he had ever done as a biology student. After several years of apprenticing with other master brewers, Mark was ready to begin crafting beer using his own recipes.    He found the perfect spot in Charlottesville, VA; a historic storefront on Main Street that was once home to the state of Virginia’s first craft brewing operation. In September 1999, Mark re-opened the doors and introduced the Starr Hill Brewery. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its historic building with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall, and it was there that Mark's delicious craft beers became a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world. Nineteen prestigious awards later, Mark’s brews continue to be a hit at beer and music festivals nationwide.    In 2005, in response to the growing demand, Mark moved from this small brewing operation to a larger brewing facility several miles outside of town, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's core and seasonal brews are now enjoyed in restaurants and music clubs throughout the Mid Atlantic and Southeast, and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores in the region.    Mark is proud of the awards his microbrews have earned, and the experts agree that he is among the best craft brewers in the country. But at the end of the day, what still matters most to Mark and his team of brewers at Starr Hill is giving people the gift of great beer.",http://www.starrhill.com/,1999,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4TuN55/upload_zLn8EZ-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4TuN55/upload_zLn8EZ-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4TuN55/upload_zLn8EZ-large.png,5391 Three Notch'D Road,Crozet,Virginia,22932,38.0692617,-78.6866452,434-823-5671,,Y,N,N,Y,tasting,Tasting Room,US,United States,USA,1999,

We have had a fantastic time making mead and meeting mead drinkers from all over the world, and now its our turn to share our love of mead with all of you!    Becky Starr, Owner, Sales/Tasting Room Manager  Ben Starr, Owner, Wine/Meadmaker    We first discovered mead in CA at the Southern California Renaissance Pleasure Faire. Several years later, we found friends that were home brewing mead with good results. We decided to try our hand at it too.    In February 2006, we entered our first competition and took Best in Show out of over 210 entries in the home mead-maker category at the International Mead Association’s Mead Festival. The competition was judged by seven professionals in the mead industry; including Ken Schramm, author of The Compleat Mead Maker, and meadery owners from around the world. The Best in Show prize was selected from the gold medal winners in nine categories. Our “Starrlight Mulled Apple Cyser” was awarded not only the gold medal in the cyser (mead made with apples) category, but was also selected as the best overall representation of mead making. It was at that point we decided to try creating a business from our love of mead.    Ben shares his expertise and love of brewing by conducting demonstrations and workshops on mead making in the local community. We also organize and conduct the local Mead Day celebration each August (since 2005) and are a key part of the product tasting team for mead reviews on Gotmead.com.

9LfmKk,Stroh Brewery Company,"A name as important to the success of Detroit as Ford or Chrysler, the Stroh family began with humble roots, brewing beer in a family-owned inn during the 18th century in Kirn, Germany. In 1848, during the German Revolution, Bernhard Stroh, having apprenticed at his father side, immigrated to the United States. He established his own brewery in Detroit in 1850. Stroh named his new company Lion's Head Brewery, adopting the Lion's Crest logo from the Kyrburg Castle in Germany – the same crest that adorns Stroh beers today    After establishing the brewery, Bernhard's son, Bernhard Jr., continued its expansion. A firm proponent of tradition and quality, he introduced the European method of fire-brewing to America. The fire-brewing process uses a direct flame rather than steam to heat beer-filled copper kettles. The resulting higher temperatures intensify the aroma and body of beer, resulting in a more flavorful brew.    During Prohibition, the Stroh family operated the business under the name The Stroh Products Company, producing near beer (beer with its alcohol extracted), birch beer, soft drinks, malt products, ice cream, and ice. Though production of most of these items ceased when Prohibition ended in 1933, Stroh Ice Cream can still be enjoyed at parlors today.    The Stroh Brewery grew alongside the other titans of Detroit industry. In 1964 the company made its first move toward expansion when it bought the Goebel Brewing Company, with an eye towards national distribution. As other national brands began to enter the Detroit market, Stroh began to aggressively pursue other markets.    In 1973, Peter Stroh's willingness to depart from years of tradition enabled Stroh's to survive, but the changes were hard to swallow for many Stroh's employees. Stroh broke the company's tradition of family management and recruited managers from other companies. He also introduced a light beer, Stroh's Light.    Though the brewery encountered many difficult times, the tradition and quality of Stroh's has never changed, and the quality of Bernhard's family-owned beer continue today, with Stroh's and Stroh's Light.",http://www.strohbeer.com/,1850,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/uV6ou7/upload_dng2E8-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/uV6ou7/upload_dng2E8-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/uV6ou7/upload_dng2E8-large.png,,Tampa,Florida,,27.94653,-82.459269,,,Y,N,Y,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,,

MfINpl,SweetWater Brewing Company,"February 17, 1997 marked the official beginning of SweetWater Brewery, and a new style of brewing and selling beer in Atlanta as the boys wandered around Atlanta in an old van with Freddy's dog Badger. After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. ""We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio"" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.    SweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in.

Mp4VNA,T.W. Pitchers',"When Wilson Barr and Tommy Hester met at Williams College in 2007, both were pitchers on the Varsity baseball team. However, they quickly realized their love of baseball was more than equaled by their love of a good drink. Despite the desolate landscape of college get-togethers where there was a strong emphasis on a drink's quantity over quality, Wilson and Tommy were able to find a shared interest in the craft beer industry. When they started an alcoholic beverage company, their adventurous attitudes translated into a desire to create a product that was truly new and exciting. The result was T.W. Pitchers’ Snake Bite®.    While in college, Wilson lived in Europe and discovered that generations of British pub-goers have enjoyed blending lager and hard apple cider. He was astonished to learn the popular concoction had only sparingly made its way across the pond to the United States. Ready to undo this injustice, he returned from his trip and founded W.G. Barr Beverage Company. Tommy was brought on board, and the dynamic duo got to work bringing Snake Bite – a bottled blend of lager and cider - to the thirsty people of America. T.W. Pitchers’, which stands for ""Two Williams Pitchers’,"" or ""Tommy and Wilson, Pitchers,"" was immediately settled on as the brand name.    After months of hard work and many late nights spent taste testing, Wilson and Tommy launched T.W. Pitchers’ Snake Bite in San Francisco. Armed with their Airstream office, a little bit of know-how, and a whole lot of gumption, Wilson and Tommy are committed to quenching your thirst, one bottle of Snake Bite at a time.

XqWTM7,TailGate Beer,"TailGate Beer was founded by a 21-year-old homebrewer, Wesley Keegan. The story goes, Wesley was approached by his father, Tim, one day about what he was going to do with his life. As an ocean lifeguard and co-owner of a bar, Wesley thought he had it made. His dad informed him of a trademark he had won in 2004 and subsequently protected in contest from Anheuser Busch. The name was TailGate Beer.    Tim thought TailGate Beer was something special. As an avid sports fan and tailgater, Tim implored Wesley to take his homebrews that people loved drinking and brew TailGate Beer! Wesley, having put himself through college at San Diego State University, grew up modestly. The gift of TailGate Beer was a generous one but, unlike some tales of entrepreneurism, didn’t come with startup funds.    They both agreed the name was solid and the marketing would one day be fun, but Wesley was emphatic that the beer had to be excellent. From there, Wesley took what he liked to brew, and brewed in Southern California. All initial beers were brewed and packaged in kegs and glass bottles. Wesley entered into the Great American Beer Festival in 2007 and although no formal awards were won, TailGate Beer was a hit! This drew lots of attention from beer fans from all over the country. The common response was “great beer!” and “great name!” So with confirmation of Wesley’s biggest apprehension – people loved the beer – TailGate Beer was born.",http://www.tailgatebeer.com,2007,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PuOZUW/upload_jjOm6o-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PuOZUW/upload_jjOm6o-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PuOZUW/upload_jjOm6o-large.png,,San Diego,California,,32.7153292,-117.1572551,858-215-4842,,Y,N,N,N,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2007,

This smalltime hobby of making beer in a tiny apartment blossomed into a fulltime career, brewing commercially. Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern California to study Fermentation Science. Upon returning to Salt Lake, he aligned himself with a startup brewery called Uinta Brewing Company. The concept for this startup was to brew the freshest beer available in the State of Utah while limiting the alcohol percentage to 3.2 by weight (4% by volume).

IdIInN,Fitchburg,"The Great Dane Pub & Brewing Company was established by college friends Eliot Butler and Rob LoBreglio. The two dreamed of starting a Brewpub that offered many varieties of house-brewed ales and lagers and hearty made-from-scratch pub fare to accompany the beers. The original Downtown location opened in November 1994 and expanded with the addition of a pool hall in 1996. The wild success of the first Great Dane led to the decision to open more pubs in the Madison area.    The Fitchburg Great Dane began operations in 2002 and the Hilldale pub followed in 2006. In 2009, the Hilldale pub expanded its brewery and opened a 4,000 square foot pool hall. Additionally, in May of 2009, the first Great Dane outside of the Madison area debuted in Wausau, Wisconsin. The Wausau Great Dane added a 100 seat beer garden and outdoor bar in the spring of 2011.

Is it an ale? Actually, it’s a lager brewed at ale temperatures. This higher temperature fermentation produces a beer with more “fruity” qualities than your average lager. The hops are 100% Northern Brewer, but Robert has lowered the hop bill to make this Steam Beer a bit more creamy and smooth.

How better to do that than open Thirsty Planet Brewing Company.    Our purpose then morphs into doing the right thing. For us, this includes being environmentally conscious. We have laced filters in our drains for run-off water, so we can use that water to irrigate our lawns and plants. We also plan to purchase solar panels for our brewery. We recycle, and you will quickly learn that after visiting our beautiful tasting room. Check out our bar, you will see what we mean.    Another important aspect of doing the right thing is through charitable donations. We have been truly blessed in life and want to give to those who are in need of a blessing. A portion of our Yellow Armadillo Wheat sales will go to a local cancer research/support foundation, and a portion of our Thirsty Goat Amber sales will go to help purchase farm animals (maybe goats?) for needy people in third world countries.

They first met in 2005 while going to the University of Minnesota for bachelor degrees in Electrical Engineering. Over time, they all worked together as hardware design engineers for a small engineering services company specializing in RF-centric products. Being young engineers working downtown Minneapolis, they attended various happy hours together. It quickly became clear that they all really loved craft beer and were very intrigued with the science of the brewing process.    Jake and Jeff are the two brewers of the company who designed and honed the recipes. They got their start in 2006 brewing extract kits on Jake's Mom's kitchen stove much to her chagrin. (A few boil-overs did occur on her stove, whoops!) They brewed countless extract kits until in 2010, when after touring Surly and Flat Earth, they were inspired to turn their passion (like the founders of those breweries) into a business. From that point forward it has been all grain brewing and loving it. Nowadays, Jake focuses on the brewing aspect of the business while Jeff focuses on the brewing as well as the business side of the operation.    George, in the early years, was a force within the brewery by helping out at every brew session and providing needed muscle for cleaning and moving material around the brewhouse.

tCTd8j,Toppling Goliath Brewing Company,"Toppling Goliath is a stealth brewery, flying fast, under the radar. This has been true since the day we quietly opened our first ½ barrel brewery and tap room on the west side of Decorah, IA in 2009. The batches were small but the taste was gigantic, and word spread like wildfire.    Today, our team brews at a larger production facility on the edge of town, regularly experimenting at the tap room to satisfy our craving for new and exciting creations. Numbers are not our game, making a lot of the same beer is just too boring, and life is just too short.    The history of Toppling Goliath lies in the dreams of tomorrow, not the pages of the past. The past is for those who rely on high volume and low value. The past is for those who duplicate rather than design. The past is for cowards.

Just kidding!!    To make a long story short, Pete and Scot spent their formative years playing baseball at the West Middleton Town Hall.  Ever since, the words ""Town Hall"" evoke memories of community, relaxing with friends and happiness.  When Pete and Scot were reacquainted in Minneapolis they opened the Town Hall.    Tucked away on the fringes of downtown Minneapolis, the Town Hall offers a refreshing alternative to other eating and drinking establishments.  Its relaxed environment attracts a diverse crowd of college students, business people, professors, theater patrons and many more.    The Town Hall makes some of the best beer in America and provides an atmosphere where its patrons can relax and enjoy them.  Please come and taste our award winning beer and fantastic food.

C6iHOv,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Tröegs Brewing Company was established in 1997 by brothers Chris and John Trogner. Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tröegs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale).     In addition to these beers, Tröegs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery.     In late 2013, Tröegs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tröegs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tröegs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works.     The Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tröegs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others.     Tröegs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tröegs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.    Our state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews.     Our Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made.

SsYPgS,Tuppers' Hop Pocket Brewing Company,"An interest in history and beer led Bob and Ellie Tupper to  a quest throughout the United States and Europe to talk to brewers and sample classic examples of traditional brewing styles.  In 1978 they began taking formal tasting notes on each new beer they could find.    By the early 1990s the Tuppers had tasted and evaluated over 6,000 beers and visited hundreds of breweries.  They had found many excellent beers, but envisioned an ale that no one had made—one that would encompass bold American flavors and traditional European brewing techniques.  They asked Old Dominion Brewing Co., which they felt was one of the very best craft breweries in the country, to work with them to develop this ideal ale.  Tuppers’ Hop Pocket Ale was the result.      In 1997 the Tuppers again worked with the Old Dominion brewers to create Tuppers’ Hop Pocket Pils, based on the Keller or Hefe Pils style of Northern Bavaria, but with a unique American boldness to the flavor.    The Tuppers live in Bethesda, Maryland, where Bob teaches history.  Ellie works in Washington as a production editor of scientific books.

AQE3Sx,Twelve Rounds Brewing Company,"Our passion for great brews and great food both began in the kitchen. Dan started brewing around 1990, using extracts.

Both Dan and Elle love to cook and brewing days became a natural outlet for hosting all days BBQs with family and friends. The 5-gallon kettle over the kitchen stove grew to a half-barrel, propane-fueled brew rig. And the backyard gained a pellet-smoker alongside the Weber grill. That’s what we call going the distance with brewing and charcuterie!    With family and friends raving about our creation, it’s time to take it seriously. We entered the 2011 California State Fair and won three medals including first place for our Knock-Out Stout and second place for The Contender – our Pale Ale. The following year we won first place for our Scottish Ale which we plan on featuring as one of our seasonal brews.    In early 2012 we decided to pursue opening our own microbrewery.

1k3h3N,Twin Lakes Brewing Company,"In 1985, while attending the University of California at Berkeley, Samuel Hobbs wrote a chemistry paper, for a laugh, on “aqueous beer foam” (the head of a beer). It would take 21 years for that initial interest to manifest itself into something drinkable. The spark would come after 9/11 while he drank homebrewed stout with five of his friends. Motivated by patriotic feelings and the American dream of creating a business, the energy was set in motion to start Twin Lakes Brewing Company. Weeks later, Sam and his longtime friends Matt Day, Jack Wick, and Mark Fesche developed a unique 15 gallon gravity fed pilot system and began working to create their first signature brews.    They decided to locate the brewery at the beautiful “Twin Lakes Farm” in Greenville, Delaware. This historic 252 acre farm has been in Sam’s family for seven generations and has a deep rock well aquifer which supplies perfect water for brewing. Local artisans converted an old tractor barn and art studio to accommodate a five vessel, gravity fed brewery and tasting room. Finally, on April 13, 2006, the first two brands, Greenville Pale Ale and Route 52 Pilsner, were launched.     Today Twin Lakes Brewery also produces Tweed’s Tavern Stout, Caesar Rodney Golden Ale and Winterthur Wheat, as well as seasonal styles Oktoberfest and Jublicious. Currently, Twin Lakes beer is available on tap at many fine restaurants and taverns in Delaware and Southeastern Pennsylvania. Growlers (half gallon jugs of beer) can be purchased at the brewery and kegs are available at most regional beer and liquor stores.",http://twinlakesbrewingcompany.com/,2006,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VcP5iA/upload_AT5fnN-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VcP5iA/upload_AT5fnN-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VcP5iA/upload_AT5fnN-large.png,4210 Kennett Pike,Greenville,Delaware,19807,39.785885,-75.602527,302-658-1826,,Y,N,N,Y,brewpub,Brewpub,US,United States,USA,2006,

After returning to the states, they had trouble finding that type of beer in Chicago so they opened Two Brothers Brewing Company in 1996.

Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including the Project Opus Sour series. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare. In 2011, the Ebel brothers purchased Walter Payton's Roundhouse located in Aurora, IL. The Two Brothers Roundhouse is a full service brewpub restaurant, music venue, offers banquet space for large parties and weddings and hosts the Two Brothers Cafe and Beer Bar!

K420Iz,Uncle Bear's Brewhouse Grill,"“COME, SIT AND STAY”    Who Was Uncle Bear, You Ask?             Well he was a fun loving good fella, of the Labrador mix named “Bear”. In the good ole’ days as a young pup, he could be found cruising the college campus at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, body surfin’ at Doggie Beach in Ocean Beach (San Diego), skiing down the snow capped mountains in Ruidoso, New Mexico, relaxing in the Hot Springs of Arkansas and finally making his home in the Valley of the Sun. Since Bear was an active dog and on the go, he wanted to create a place where he and his friends could “Come, Sit And Stay”.        Well Uncle Bears’ Brewhouse Grill is that place. Born out of Bear’s  love for craft beer and excellent food, we have created an upbeat, fun atmosphere where friends, family and co-workers can come to enjoy a variety of delicious menu selections & NOW our own locally brewed craft beer. The Uncle Bear’s Brewhouse opened in 2013, as well as the 4 Grill and Bar locations were re-branded to the Grill and Tap concept that same year.    On the menu, whenever you see Bear’s paw print  you can be assured the item is a long-term house favorite or a new favorite we are sure Bear would have loved. Try any one of the items from the “Famous” Sliders, Backyard Burgers and Birds, Big Plates and Serious Sizzles, Gourmet Pizza, Bear “Bites” or Wing selections and you are in for a true treat.        The unique motif has been designed to resemble all of the places Bear or your family dog would hang out such as the garage, backyard or home.     In addition to the excellent food menu, we feature fantastic house drinks and NOW a wonderful selection of craft beers brewed on site in our state of the art display brewery. Be sure to try a Flight Bone (5-4oz. tasters) or a Growler (64oz. take-home jug) or a pint of our craft beer.

Rs3OQM,Weeping Radish Farm Brewery,"The Weeping Radish is the Oldest Microbrewery in North Carolina. 25 years ago it was illegal for breweries to sell their own beer directly to consumers; they had to go through a distributor. This made it impossible for microbreweries or small brewpubs to exist. In 1985 Uli Bennewitz went to his local senator and together they passed a bill allowing microbreweries to sell their own beer on site. A year later on the July 4th, 1986 the Weeping Radish Brewery opened for business.      Raised in a small village in Bavaria, Uli was determined to bring the high quality beer he was used to across the ocean to North Carolina. A Master Brewer came over from Germany and brewed the first batches of Corolla Gold, Fest, and Black Radish. Strictly adhering to the Reinheitsgebot Purity Law of 1516, all Weeping Radish beers are brewed using hops, malt, yeast and water â€“ no additives, chemicals or preservatives.      Our beer list has expanded over the years and currently on draft in the pub we have the OBX KÃ¶lsch, IPA 25, and Radler as well as our original Corolla Gold, Fest and Black Radish.

Popular tastes in beer have changed and matured, as have the brewing process and ingredients.

We utilized the same process to roll out other Lithia Premium Beers such as Bucky Blonde Ale, arguably the most complex, richest blonde beer ever brewed.    Most importantly, Lithia Beer will again, and exclusively, be based in West Bend & Washington County, where it belongs.

So with little more than the stick in his hand and the Hops in his hanker chief, he journeyed West. Upon arriving in the West he hopped from the tailgate, choked on the dust, and kicked a tumble weed rolling his direction. This is the West, the place full of opportunity “he asked himself” and sighed but after a few Wicked Cold months, the landscape began to change, grass became lush green, trees bloomed and the flowers opened. The Wicked Beaver found the warm days, and cool nights were perfect to pursue his passion.

From that conversation forward there would be no looking back. A business plan was developed and hundreds of test batches brewed. In 2011 Walt and Luke’s lifelong friend Ryan Guthy and his parents Rick and Denise all sat down at their house in the mountains of Western North Carolina to taste some of Luke and Walt’s creations while looking over the plans for what would be Wicked Weed Brewing.  After being thoroughly impressed with the full flavor and vision of the project, the Guthys joined the Dickinsons and the team was assembled.  Over the next months Wicked Weed Brewing found a home at 91 Biltmore avenue, a building that seemed destined to be a brewery.  With the creativity of Luke, vision of Walt, dedication of Ryan, exquisite taste of Denise and wisdom of Rick a truly unique brewery was born.  So from the humble beginning of a basement, the dream of Wicked Weed Brewing has come to life. Our beer is bold, full of excitement and flavor.

YbkkwZ,Wildcard Brewing Company,"Wildcard Brewing Company was just a dream until experience, encouragement and circumstance made it a reality. The idea behind the name Wildcard is to pursue the unknown. Wildcard Brewing Company’s owners left stability for chaos, moved to England to learn the craft of beer making, and started a business in an uncertain economy, all in pursuit of a dream. You’d call them crazy, adventurous, unpredictable....a wildcard. Our story is one of the unexpected; a place where there are no limits, where perseverance and a free spirit will turn dreams into reality.     It started when Jeff and Jenny brewed two beers to give away as wedding favors at a brewery in San Luis Obispo where they went to college. Homebrew projects and burst bottle explosions ensued in the years after. But a casual passion soon turned career as Jeff and Jenny headed to England. Jeff studied brewing science at the University of Sunderland and Jenny conducted “research” in various local pubs. Once back in the states Jeff headed straight for the most competitive brewing location, the Pacific Northwest. Now 4 years later the pair are back in Jeff’s hometown of Redding building out their production brewery.    Wildcard is small startup business focused on brewing flavorful beers and enriching the communities that enjoy them. Spending dollars locally is just a part of that commitment. We will source products and services within 500 miles of our facility as much as possible and intend to exclusively sell beers within that same area. Supporting local businesses not only has great economic impacts but environmental as well. We don’t want to just do business in the Redding community we want to be a part of it. It is important to give back as much as possible to the community and we will make it a point to donate and get involved in local causes and efforts.",http://www.wildcardbrewingco.com/,2012,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TD4EGg/upload_DQdvya-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TD4EGg/upload_DQdvya-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TD4EGg/upload_DQdvya-large.png,9565 Crossroads Dr,Redding,California,96003,40.565865,-122.297279,(530) 722-9239,Wed - Thu: 2:00 pm - 8:00 pm  Fri - Sat: 12:00 pm - 9:00 pm  Sun: 12:00 pm - 5:00 pm,Y,N,N,Y,nano,Nano Brewery,US,United States,USA,2012,

Nebraska natives, Peter and Margaret lived and worked in Minneapolis for many years before moving to Worth County, where Peter’s grandparents had lived and farmed and where Peter had spent much time as a boy.     Having already established Margaret’s engineering business in downtown Northwood, the couple turned next to Peter’s passion – brewing great beer. For 24 years, Peter has brewed award-winning beer, winning contests, teaching others and perfecting classic recipes along the way. He’s a BJCP National Beer Judge, has brewed professionally with Summit Brewing Company of St. Paul, Minn., and worked on staff at one of the country’s most popular brewing supply shops.    Worth Brewing Company is Peter and Margaret’s way of helping to reintroduce a great tradition – the locally owned brewery serving hand-crafted, high-quality, distinctive beers for the enjoyment of locals and lucky visitors.

Proud of their product, they were eager to share it with friends. An instant favorite, it wasn't long until they realized their modest homebrewing operation wasn't going to be enough to satisfy the growing demand.    During the early 1990s, many breweries opened, and craft brewing started to gain popularity. Working in a small English-style brewery in Western Maryland, Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit decided to take matters into their own hands, and in 1994, they founded Yards Brewing Company.",http://www.yardsbrewing.com/,1994,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jwWiTH/upload_pXUGPy-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jwWiTH/upload_pXUGPy-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jwWiTH/upload_pXUGPy-large.png,901 N.

Trying to make tires more round proved to be less fulfilling than making great beer, so with the encouragement of Lila, Linus quit his job, got a business degree from Vanderbilt and a craft-brewing education through a course at the American Brewer's Guild, and did an internship under Garrett Oliver at Brooklyn Brewery. Linus found a used 10 bbl brewing system from a brewpub in Iowa that had gone out of business, and went to work restoring a corner of the old Marathon Motorworks building for their brewery.

4V6C7Y,Yellowhammer Brewery,"Launched in late 2010 in downtown Huntsville, Yellowhammer Brewing seeks to bring Belgian and German tradition to Alabama. That means Euopean styles, but with a slight Southern interpretation.  Thanks to Free the Hops and the change in Alabama's formerly restrictive beer laws, creativity in brewing has come to Alabama.    At Yellowhammer, head brewer Keith Yager draws inspiration from both Belgian and German brewing traditions. An accomplished home brewer since 1995, Yager has designed numerous seasonal and specialty batches, from the Dark Hammer Belgian Quad to the UberAlt sticke ale. Other recurring ales are more experimental, blending styles, as with Tobacco Road, an imperial amber designed to complement a good cigar, or the occasional Lonesome Hop series, which spotlights the character of an individual hop. Yellowhammer is Yager's first commercial undertaking.    Yellowhammer Brewing opened on Oct. 16, 2010 with the best-selling Belgian white ale and the IPA. Other staples sold throughout the year include a German style altbier and the Miracle Worker, a potent Belgian tripel.",http://www.yellowhammerbrewery.com/,2010,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BI8mE7/upload_h0FCyk-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BI8mE7/upload_h0FCyk-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BI8mE7/upload_h0FCyk-large.png,2406 Clinton Avenue,West Huntsville,Alabama,35805,34.722525,-86.603703,256-975-5950,,Y,N,N,Y,micro,Micro Brewery,US,United States,USA,2010,

wV9Hut,ÆppelTreow Winery & Distillery,"ÆppelTreow Winery & Distillery is a producer of small batch cider, perry and spirits.    Cider and Perry?  We use the pre-Prohibition meaning of ‘cider’, so we’re talking about fermented or ‘hard’ cider. Perry is the pear analogue to cider.  We use lots of different kinds of apples and pears in our products.  Some modern.  Some heirloom – no longer grown for stores. We make a range of styles: sparkling, draft, still/table, and fortified/dessert.  Within a style, we lean to the dry end – but also have some medium-sweet offerings.    We are also a distillery.  We use Wisconsin grown crops and wood to make whiskey and brandies.  Distilled spirits may be powerful, but they are also flexible.  They are nice neat (straight up), and even more fun in cocktails.  We encourage people to mix our products up and add their own creative touch.",http://www.aeppeltreow.com/,,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/FbJSGN/upload_tU8JqF-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/FbJSGN/upload_tU8JqF-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/FbJSGN/upload_tU8JqF-large.png,1072 288th Ave,Burlington,Wisconsin,53105,42.642658,-88.160186,(262) 878-5345,Fri:  12:00pm - 5:00pm Sat:  10:00am - 5:00pm Sun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm  ,Y,N,N,Y,cidery,Cidery,US,United States,USA,,

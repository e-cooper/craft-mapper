The first batch of Berghoff beer was brewed in Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1887 by Herman Berghoff and his three brothers. Herman\u2019s desire to expand the market for the family\u2019s beer led him to sell the product at the Chicago World\u2019s Fair where it received high acclaim. Since then, Berghoff has continued its success and relevance in the Chicago market and beyond.           \r\n\r\n   As the craft beer market has evolved, the brand has received fresh, exciting updates. Berghoff changed its brewing location and is now proudly brewed at Point Brewery in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Berghoff has also refreshed itself with updated recipes and packaging. With consulting from brewing experts Randy Mosher and John Hannafan, Berghoff\u2019s new, top-notch beers are ready to satisfy consumer demand. As the brewery looks to the future, Berghoff beer will continue to evolve as trends change, but will always maintain its roots as an authentic German-style brew whose history and tradition will never be forgotten.","website":"http:\/\/berghoffbeer.com\/","established":"1887","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_5EzK2B-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_5EzK2B-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_5EzK2B-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-16 18:24:04","updateDate":"2013-08-09 16:17:53","id":"kU9sBG","streetAddress":"3122 W.

The concept was simple: make a variety of beers that WE wanted to drink and create a tasting opportunity for our customers to come into the brewery to decide what they liked, and buy to go.\r\n\r\nDuring our first year of operation we released over 20 different beers, underwent one expansion, and our MO remains the same as it was in the beginning. In addition to the retail store our beers can also be found in over 30 local bars and restaurants.\r\n\r\nYou can be sure when you pick up a glass or bottle of our beer that you\u2019re drinking a fresh local product. We work that little old brew house like a pack mule to crank out as much beer as possible. Nearly all of our beer is sold to customers within a week of leaving our brite tanks.

Big Muddy Brewing in Murphysboro, Illinois is much like many of these new \u201cmicrobreweries\u201d all over the country, reinvigorating an industry and continuing a heritage that has skipped several generations.\r\nUntil 1940, Murphysboro was the home of a thriving brewery and until prohibition; it was one of the cornerstones of the town\u2019s industry. In 1910, the Stecher Brewing Company produced more than 40,000 barrels of beer a year. However, passage of the Volstead Act in 1919, which ushered in the era of prohibition, began a slow decline to the brewery\u2019s demise.\r\nBig Muddy Brewing\u2019s founder Chuck Stuhrenberg attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale in the 1980s. After graduation, he opened a franchise of Chicago\u2019s Rosati\u2019s Pizza in Carbondale and in 1990, began another venture, Spray Shield Industries.\r\nIt was while Stuhrenberg was in college at SIU that he began making his own beer.\r\nStuhrenberg and his college buddies would homebrew, and as the years went on, he began to take his hobby more seriously.\r\nStuhrenberg always had professional brewing in the back of his mind, but it stayed a hobby until 2009. In July, 2009, Big Muddy Brewing finally began production, the first brewery in Murphysboro in over 50 years.\r\nThe first beer offered by Big Muddy Brewing is Kinkaid Wheat. It was a recipe popular with Stuhrenberg\u2019s family and friends. It was also something he felt would be a good \u201ccraft beer transition brew\u201d for those used to the conventional corporate brew (BMC).\r\nKinkaid Wheat is currently offered on tap and by bottle in bars, restaurants and liquor stores across Southern Illinois alongside of Big Muddy Brewing\u2019s second selection, \u201cSaluki Dunkel Dog\u201d, a dark, amber\/dunkel style beer.\r\nThe third and newest addition to Big Muddy Brewing\u2019s lineup is an ale called \u201cBig Muddy Pale Ale\u201d, and future varieties include \u201cLogan\u2019s Lager\u201d.","website":"http:\/\/www.bigmuddybrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_5b1YpK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_5b1YpK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_5b1YpK-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2013-04-30 14:46:55","id":"QkdgSV","streetAddress":"1430 North 7th Street","locality":"Murphysboro","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"62966","phone":"(618) 684-8833","website":"http:\/\/www.bigmuddybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sat: 11:00 am - 3:00 pm\r\n`","latitude":37.7823381,"longitude":-89.3321145,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"jMkADP","name":"Big Rapids Brewing Company","website":"http:\/\/www.bluecowcafe.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2012-04-09 18:47:52","id":"34MUbw","streetAddress":"119 N.

Starting from this assumption, in 1999 The Tarricone Family takes over a factory, built in the '80es upon instruction of HM the Prince of Windisgraetz of the Austrian Family of Furstenberg who then bought the Prinz Brau Group. Later, in the '90es, this latter was acquired together with the Birra Moretti Group, by the Labatt Group.\r\nIn the next years, the Moretti-Prinz Brau Group was acquired by Interbrau and eventually by Heineken.\r\nThe entire know-how and the workers themselves have been kept by Drive Beer, thus assuring a continuity in the excellence of the brands produced. \r\nThe art of manufacturing fermented products and yeasts management is in the DNA of the Tarricone Family. Precisely, in the first years of 1900, the ancestor Giuseppe Tarricone owned several vineyards and produced an excellent wine. He was producing and selling his wine all across the inland of Lucania transporting it on his picturesque chariots drawn by horses. \r\nHe then moved the company office to Atella (PZ), and then to Bella (PZ), and eventually, bewitched by the beautiful landscape and the extraordinary nature of the surroundings of Muro Lucano (PZ), he settled down, together with his entire family of Corato origins, he married a Muro Lucano girl, whose name was Concetta Bianchini.\r\nTherefore, when in 1999 the Tarricone Family was suggested by Gerardo, one of the sons of the ancestor Giuseppe Tarricone, to take over the Brewery, belonging to the Heineken Group, it was almost physiological to the five brothers, Giuseppe, Vito, Carlo, Federico e Fabrizio, who at that time were expanding their businesses linked somehow to the food and beverages sectors, to accept this \"challenge\", which represented for the Tarricone Family a \"return to the origins\".\r\nThe Drive Beer, an industry of the national market, has managed to impose itself as a beer pole, entirely Italian, competing with the most famous multinational companies.\r\nFinally, the Company, based on the remarkable approvals made by operators, has then invested time and resources by recurring to the skills of expert advisors for realising an distributing the products.","website":"http:\/\/www.birramorena.com","established":"1999","isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-02 19:51:45","updateDate":"2014-03-03 11:54:52","id":"A5ES81","streetAddress":"Z.I.

He rents a former \"tavern\" with an attached mini apartment on the top floor and a gravel courtyard on the back and opens its doors. At first, his passion for beer, and a little 'light his aversion for wine led him to fill the menu with more than two hundred references international beers, as well as dainties to enjoy to work alongside the crepes. Gradually, the goodness of the choices made \u200b\u200bgood name and port customers to small local baptized \"Le Baladin\" by his friend Fran\u00e7ois of CIRQUE BIDON in homage to the nature of Teo same. Years went by and the room expands, you change, you will see a big circus tent to cover the courtyard paved with gravel now tables and chairs in style \"Oktoberfest\" and hand in hand also changes his mentor: Nora is now its new companion and muse together and decide a new course of the local : transform the creperie in a brewpub! After months of study and travel with Nora to discover Belgian brewers have our hero returns with huge bins loaded onto a van Volkswagen Westfalia and places them in the garage of the ousted former owner of the house, adjacent to the restaurant, now transformed into a microbrewery.

Over time, the production will be moved to other places for sizing issues and logistics, but still the aura of magic that permeated the early days of the brewery remains unchanged. Today, large kitchen has taken the place of the production and in the pub beers are on tap now classic carnet baladiniano as well as all production in the bottle. Occasionally a few small tweaks gives customers reason of surprise and veiled \"Amarcord\" in which one of them remembers the beginnings of this place, now a destination for \"pilgrimage\" by many fans of the beer world.

The success of the brewery, apart from the Pub, lies in the fact that the most part of the produced beer is bottled and sold to other pubs, in both, bottles and kegs. The passion and eagerness of this group will take you to a new and unforgettable experience.","website":"http:\/\/www.birrificiolambrate.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Xe7AW7\/upload_6KAJEB-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Xe7AW7\/upload_6KAJEB-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Xe7AW7\/upload_6KAJEB-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-26

Our Brewmasters do everything by hand on a small scale. It's a great place to learn about beer because, unlike a modern commercial brewery, you can see every step in the process for yourself. And, no one else has a Brewmaster ready to welcome visitors in period costume.\r\n\r\nIn the 1860s there were 155 registered breweries in Ontario, and countless smaller operations. Black Creek Historic Brewery is the first in this province to replicate the brewing processes of that era, when there was no electricity or refrigeration, no stainless steel tanks or bottling plants.\r\n\r\nThe equipment at Black Creek Historic Brewery is made mainly of wood and copper, and the beer ferments the way it was done in the old days, with wooden barrels to age the beer. Malted barley is shoveled by hand into the wort tun where it is boiled into a mash. After filtering the solids through a linen cloth, the sugary liquid is boiled and hops are added, both for flavouring and as a natural preservative. Once the boiling is complete, the beer is put in barrels where the yeast is added. A short time later, the beer is ready!\r\n\r\nVisitors can sample the beer at cellar temperature, the way it was enjoyed in the past, or drink a chilled pint in the pub, the way many people prefer it today.

Brothers Jason and Tom Sobocinski come from a Polish\/Italian family where food and drink is always the focus of every gathering. From Jason\u2019s wedding to his son\u2019s birthdays, roasting a pig has become the favorite way to celebrate any special occasion. Tyler Jones, an old family friend and former brewer of The Portsmouth Brewery in New Hampshire, contacted Jason and Tom with a plan to move to New Haven so his wife and son could be closer to their family. With a plan in the works to form a brewery that would celebrate family and food, they needed to encompass all that they were passionate about. When they celebrate, they roast a hog and the Berkshire hog is the breed of choice, thus Black Hog brewing was born! \r\n\r\nBlack Hog Brewing (BHB) will have a strong tie to local agriculture with a focus on unique craft brews that are pleasant to drink and pair well with foods of all types. Black Hog Brewing will craft year round and seasonal brews with a seasonal Farm Land Series dedicating a percentage of proceeds to support CT Farm Land. 3-4 pig roasts per year, using CT raised Berkshire pigs fed our spent brewing grains will celebrate the release of our seasonal brews. We hope you\u2019ll enjoy Black Hog Brewing Company at one of our pig roasts soon or whatever occasion brings you together for great beer and food with friends and family.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackhogbrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_wvB5LD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_wvB5LD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_wvB5LD-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-24 01:04:56","updateDate":"2014-09-23 14:18:17","id":"LoZU74","streetAddress":"115 Hurley Rd","extendedAddress":"Bldg 9A","locality":"Oxford","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06478","website":"http:\/\/www.blackhogbrewing.com","latitude":41.4757707,"longitude":-73.1520822,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-24 01:04:56","updateDate":"2014-08-25 11:53:08","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"BdqPqo","name":"Black Hole Beer Company","description":"Our Taproom features a modern yet casual atmosphere where can enjoy a rotating selection of fine craft beer, wine, homemade sangria, whiskey, as well as some light fare.

The results were award-winning products with a reputation for craft excellence.\r\n\r\nGREAT BEER FROM WINE COUNTRY\r\nAs one of Temecula\u2019s first craft breweries, Black Market introduced locally brewed beers to the community. Now found far beyond Temecula, Black Market beers are on shelves and in establishments throughout Southern California, Arizona and Washington.\r\n\r\nLEADING A MOVEMENT\r\nLike many craft breweries before us, we have followed stories of those who came before us.

At this time it is ready to be filtered carbonated and kegged.","website":"http:\/\/www.bluehillsbrewery.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AButIj\/upload_qvaAT4-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AButIj\/upload_qvaAT4-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AButIj\/upload_qvaAT4-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2012-04-23 18:32:33","id":"LTLdF5","streetAddress":"1020 Turnpike St","locality":"Canton","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02021","phone":"781-821-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.bluehillsbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Gift Shop:\r\nMon-Fri 9:00 am - 5:00pm\r\n\r\nTastings: \r\nFri:\t3:30 pm - 6:30 pm\r\nSat:\t2:00 pm\t- 6:00 pm","latitude":42.150538,"longitude":-71.103699,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"ImMO31","name":"Blue House Cafe","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:16","id":"xn4ROW","streetAddress":"62467 Nehalem Highway","locality":"North Vernonia","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97064","phone":"503-429-4350","latitude":45.9007047,"longitude":-123.1509017,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"VHPUNE","name":"Blue Lab Brewing Co","description":"Blue Lab Brewing is a small micro-brewery that produces fresh small batch ales for purchase in 1L and 2L growlers.","website":"http:\/\/www.bluelabbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VHPUNE\/upload_jbVAWn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VHPUNE\/upload_jbVAWn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VHPUNE\/upload_jbVAWn-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:16","id":"a6nFXx","streetAddress":"123 S Randolph St","locality":"Lexington","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"24450","phone":"540-458-0146","website":"http:\/\/www.bluelabbrewing.com\/","latitude":37.782865,"longitude":-79.443399,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"jTeqvA","name":"Blue Lobster Brewing Company","description":"Blue Lobster Brewing Company will be coming to Hampton, New Hampshire in 2012!

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave.

In the mountains of Tennessee gathered a very small group of friends and family including Jason\u2019s cousin Kymberly and her then boyfriend Jamie Robinson. After an intimate ceremony, the entire group enjoyed a reception complete with homemade guacamole and a tub full of crudely marked \u201chomebrews\u201d prepared by Jason. Prior to this, he had been working in high-end restaurants as a general manager, bartender and food server for over 20 years. He spent several years in Northern California learning the fine art of winemaking at a local winery in Sonoma. During this time Jason realized the beauty of brewing beer and his desire to share his creation(s) with others. He\u2019s been brewing out of his kitchen sink for several years now, slowly perfecting his recipes, offering to teach others the art, and, most importantly, making and drinking some real good beer. Jamie, who has yet to find a brew he will not try, immediately was interested in Jason\u2019s creations and quickly started picking his brain on the processes and formalities for creating these \u201chomebrews\u201d. While sucking down a few well-crafted brews in the hot sun, Jamie and Jason talked about their love of beer and the groundwork was laid.\r\n\r\nA few months later, Jamie received a phone call from Jason, who had been mulling over the possibility of moving forward with the beer making, he then proposed the idea of moving to Pennsylvania. Jason asked if Jamie would be interested in working together and the dream of opening a brewery was declared. In 2007, Jason and his wife moved to West Chester, PA where many of his family live.

Even today, the Netherlands is the major destination of Achouffe Beers outside Belgium. Nowadays, more than 20 countries worldwide are supplied with our \u2018nectar\u2019 from the Ardennes forests. Coveted international awards have also been received year after year to reward their unique taste.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the summer of 2006 the founders of the Brewery chose to entrust the future of their dear elves to the Duvel Moortgat Brewery.

It became known in the region for brewing beers like \"La Druide\" and \"Brunehaut 8\u00b0\". In 1991 the company took on a new challenge and moved into modern buildings while maintaining its traditional character and the quality of its products, qualified as \"grand crus\" by connoisseurs. An alliance of Modernity and Tradition!\r\nThese are the company's motto, a real creed for the managers at Brunehaut Brewery.\r\n\r\nTradition, because the traditional brewery retains the entirely natural brewing method for late fermentation beers and that are refermented in bottles and kegs. The result: a panel of about a dozen abbey or organic beers, all valuable and unique. To ensure that the link to the region remains strong, the types of barley used in the brewing process are grown in our own farm at Gaurain-Ramecroix.\r\n\r\nModern, because modern and high performance machinery ensure scrupulous compliance with hygiene regulations and a top quality production with consistent flavour. Also modern in how we deal with the market: several beers from Brunehaut won prizes at international competitions and are currently present in 25 different countries.\r\nMarc-Antoine De Mees and his staff are still equally enthusiastic to allow the discovery of this knowledge and method.\u2026","website":"http:\/\/www.brunehaut.com\/","established":"1890","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gOaK1T\/upload_9MUB4f-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gOaK1T\/upload_9MUB4f-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gOaK1T\/upload_9MUB4f-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

A lot of our beers have been lovingly referred to as so finely crafted that they seem to be made for a serious wine drinkers palate.

The point being, we make complex, delicate, nuanced beers, not just the same typical west coast hop bombs or dark extremely high alcohol brews (though we make quality versions of those too). Our goal is to show the whole spectrum of beer, its history, and its evolution. To show beer its proper reverence, as not only \"The people's beverage\", but one that pairs as well with food as wine, and when it's skillfully crafted and not over hopped to hide the flaws in production, it does. The truth is, it takes more skill to make a delicate lager, than a double IPA.

The Ayinger Brewery has been owned and operated by the same family since 1878 and represents one of the most pleasant and interesting small breweries which are typical of Europe. Brewing good beer is the premier duty of Aying, and people come from all over the world to sample the wares.\r\n\r\nIn a land of wonderful breweries, Ayinger is considered a benchmark of excellence. In recent years, Ayinger regularly places first in every category entered in the World Beer Championships; the brewery has gold medals from the Helsinki Beer Fest, the Stockholm Beer & Whiskey Festival, the Calagary Brewfest, and the Deutsche Landwirtschaftsgesellschaft (German Agricultural Society).","website":"http:\/\/en.ayinger-bier.de\/","established":"1878","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hD9pCH\/upload_cTQXXV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hD9pCH\/upload_cTQXXV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hD9pCH\/upload_cTQXXV-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2012-04-21 12:27:16","id":"rBxNNF","streetAddress":"M\u00fcnchner Stra\u00dfe 21","locality":"Aying","postalCode":"85653","phone":"49-(0)8095-\/-9065-0","website":"http:\/\/en.ayinger-bier.de\/","latitude":47.970655,"longitude":11.779446,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"JWsdLi","name":"Brauerei Beck","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:04","id":"TVgBWg","streetAddress":"Am Deich 18-19","locality":"Bremen","region":"Bremen","phone":"49-(0)421-\/-50940","latitude":53.0787,"longitude":8.79008,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"0HAazs","name":"Brauerei Blank","website":"http:\/\/www.brauerei-blank.de\/","established":"1878","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:17:18","updateDate":"2012-08-13 11:25:33","id":"XQzpOM","streetAddress":"Von-Speth-Str. 19","locality":"Zwiefaltendorf","region":"Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg","postalCode":"88499","latitude":48.215107,"longitude":9.516896,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:47:51","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"kwXwyf","name":"Brauerei C. & A.

In this era the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF \u2013 then called OBERG\u00c4RIGE BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF (TOP-FERMENTING BEWERY) \u2013 was founded in the Cologne quarter \u201cSeverinsviertel\u201d in 1894. Its founder, Heinrich Rei\u00dfdorf, derived from an old-established farmer family who were based in Zieverich \u2013 today a quarter of Bergheim\/Erft \u2013 as farriers and coach builders. A few years later, in 1905, the name K\u00f6lsch was established for the top-fermented Cologne beer-speciality. Before, it was called \u201cWiess\u201d. After Heinrich\u2019s death on 25.02.1901, Gertrud Rei\u00dfdorf managed the brewery until 1908. The continuance of the company had never been in danger, though, since the Rei\u00dfdorf couple had five sons, Johann Hubert, Heinrich, Hermann, Friedrich and Carl Rei\u00dfdorf.\r\n\r\nWhen the product range was diversified to further styles of beer \u2013 M\u00e4rzen, Export (both a strong variation of Lager) and Pilsen \u2013 in 1923 the top-fermenting brewery was renamed to BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF \u2013 OHG. In 1917, when the men had gone fighting in World War I, Friedrich\u2019s wife Katharina managed the brewery. The two had three sons: Heinrich Rei\u00dfdorf, who was killed in an accident in the brewery in 1936; and the two proprietors Hermann-Josef and Karl-Heinz, who died in 1996 and 1997. They led the company through economically difficult times after World War II, when the brewery was destroyed to the extent of 90%. Against all odds, the two brothers managed to produce and bottle a \u201cEinfachbier\u201d (literally: simple beer) with 2-4% vol. alc. Today the business is continued in the fourth generation.\r\n\r\nDue to a prosperous development of the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF, a new site for the brewery had to be found within the boundaries of the city of Cologne. Therefore, the company purchased premises in an industrial park in Cologne-Rodenkirchen. With the new production facility, a brewery with most modern brewing technology was built, which meets the highest quality criteria.\r\n\r\nContinuity and a sense for the necessary are the virtues which make possible to look back on 110 years of an existing PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF. The ongoing success and the positioning of the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF in the highly competitive K\u00f6lsch-sector confirm this corporate philosophy imposingly.","website":"http:\/\/www.reissdorf.de","established":"1894","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2012-07-31

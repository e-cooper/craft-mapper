Well, it\u2019s about the only brewery in Vermont that\u2019s located above Burlington. Period.\r\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not it. Not entirely.\r\n\r\nYou see \u2013 this is your beer.

It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality. Thank you to all those who have helped me get here.\r\n\r\n- Grant Pauly, 3 Sheeps Brewing","website":"http:\/\/www.3sheepsbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_c8CRE6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_c8CRE6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_c8CRE6-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-08 20:04:30","updateDate":"2012-10-09 21:21:27","id":"5R4Akp","streetAddress":"1327 North 14th Street","locality":"Sheboygan","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53081","phone":"920-395-3583","website":"http:\/\/www.3sheepsbrewing.com\/","latitude":43.7590398,"longitude":-87.7229469,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-08 20:05:17","updateDate":"2014-10-06 15:44:18","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"ucVIMa","name":"3 Stars Brewing Company","description":"3 Stars Brewing is a DC based production brewery founded by Mike McGarvey and Dave Coleman to provide the community with great, fresh, local craftbeer. \r\n\r\nWe are looking forward to opening our doors in 2011.

Let me explain. 350 Augusta Ave. was our address in Dekalb, IL. At the time, your founders Todd and Erik spent more time on projects like way below average punk rock bands in the attic, and a Hardcore Wrestling Federation called WCVF (this took place in our kitchen), instead of focusing on classes like Humanities 227 in DuSable Hall. I mean, have you ever choke slammed one of your best friends into an oven pre-heated to \"550 degrees\"? Well i have, and that was just a random Wednesday night. This raw energy (stupidity) and creativity is what eventually drew us to the Craft Beer scene. That\u2019s what craft beer is\u2026a creative and fresh twist on a beverage that has been mass produced and shoved down our throats for much too long (carefully stepping down from soapbox). Why not name our Brewery after the point in our life when we were most creative? Well\u2026..we did. It was during these times we were also introduced to good, quality beer.\r\n\r\nOnce NIU had enough of our shenanigans, Erik went on to continue his education while I submerged myself into the cesspool known as corporate America. I feel dirty just talking about it. Over the last decade, my soul has been slowly rotting and exiting my body so there was a need for this creative juice to be squeezed once again. Since wrestling and punk rock was now out of the question, brewing beer quickly became that much needed release from the Groundhog Day that had become the norm for us. Erik like most homebrewers started out brewing with extract several years ago and quickly rose to the challenge of all-grain batches. Erik, the 350 Head brewer, has been very successful when entering brewing competitions walking away with multiple awards for his Porter and Patersbier. Myself on the other hand have had a love for flavorful craft beer for many moons, and once I learned of Erik\u2019s brewing expertise years ago, I too became emerged in this brewing lifestyle. It was a match made in heaven. Erik brewed awesome beer, and I was awesome at drinking and sharing that beer!!! \r\n\r\nFrom that point on things just sort of clicked and for the last 2 years Erik and I have been researching and concocting this master plan of opening a brewery. The time has come. We want all of you to enjoy this journey with us. Tinley Park has always been our #1 choice for the 350 Brewing Company. Downtown Tinley Park embodies the spirit of 350. With great electricity in the downtown area, coupled with an amazing artistic feel, will definitely pair well with our vision of always making sure a visit to our brewery is an interesting experience. We feel Tinley Park is ready for a neighborhood brewery. It really was an easy decision based on Tinley Park\u2019s sense of community and passion for supporting local products.\r\n\r\nWe are looking forward to joining the family of incredible Illinois Brewers. We should all thank our lucky stars that we live in a state with such high quality Breweries.","website":"http:\/\/350Brewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/W3pb09\/upload_pRw6FS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/W3pb09\/upload_pRw6FS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/W3pb09\/upload_pRw6FS-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-25 13:35:25","updateDate":"2014-07-25 13:35:25","id":"1mRL8J","streetAddress":"7144 183rd St","locality":"Tinley Park","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60477","website":"http:\/\/350Brewing.com","latitude":41.5593734,"longitude":-87.7911748,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-25 13:36:01","updateDate":"2014-07-25 13:36:01","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"N101SS","name":"38 State Brewing Company","description":"We started out years ago brewing in our garage.

The annual production of beer is aprox. 10 mill liter (85 000 barrels), and together with the production of 18 mill liters of soft drinks and mineralwater it gives employment to approximately 150 people.  You may wonder how we got our name ? It was a young fellow with the name Poul Lauritz Aass that bought the brewery in 1860. Since then it has been in the same family, and is today run by the 4th generation of Aass. (By the way - A real Norwegian viking would pronounce it Ouse)  The brewery is proud of its history. To us the quality of what we produce has always been and always will be the main issue. In 1516, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria established a law admitting only malted barley, hops yeast, and water as ingredients in the production of beer. The law is known as the purity law and Aass Brewery is still loyal to Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria. In Norway the brewery is known for outstanding quality and large number of different beer types.","website":"http:\/\/www.aass.no","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_fgq5cE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_fgq5cE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_fgq5cE-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2012-12-16 14:42:39","id":"gaVq6l","streetAddress":"Ole Steensgt. 10 Postboks 1530","locality":"Drammen","phone":"47-32-26-60-00","website":"http:\/\/www.aass.no","latitude":59.731819,"longitude":10.190885,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NO","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Norway","isoThree":"NOR","numberCode":578,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"BVG7Ls","name":"Abandon Brewing Company","description":"Overlooking beautiful Keuka Lake, we brew many different Belgian and Farmstyle craft beers for the Penn Yan and surrounding Finger Lakes areas.","website":"http:\/\/www.abandonbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BVG7Ls\/upload_rudcw3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BVG7Ls\/upload_rudcw3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BVG7Ls\/upload_rudcw3-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-24 11:36:49","updateDate":"2014-03-09 22:11:36","id":"WLxlVR","streetAddress":"2994 Merritt Hill Road","locality":"Penn Yan","region":"New York","postalCode":"14527","phone":"(585) 209-3276","website":"http:\/\/www.abandonbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sat:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\n\n","latitude":42.631829,"longitude":-77.104915,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-24 11:37:40","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:38:47","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"dleKhW","name":"Abashiri Beer","website":"http:\/\/www.takahasi.co.jp","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dleKhW\/upload_75ZnW0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dleKhW\/upload_75ZnW0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dleKhW\/upload_75ZnW0-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-21 16:39:09","updateDate":"2012-12-21 16:39:17"},{"id":"5ac2lB","name":"Abbaye de Leffe","website":"http:\/\/www.abbaye-de-leffe.be\/","established":"1121","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.abbaye-de-leffe.be\/Contact,419","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/5ac2lB\/upload_mbL7F2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/5ac2lB\/upload_mbL7F2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/5ac2lB\/upload_mbL7F2-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2014-05-06 12:00:03","id":"IuEeGC","streetAddress":"Dinant","locality":"Dinant","region":"Namur","phone":"+32 (0)82 22 23 77","website":"http:\/\/www.abbaye-de-leffe.be\/","latitude":50.260479,"longitude":4.91193,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"huKquc","name":"Abbaye de Maredsous","description":"Beer Maredsous is a beer Belgian of high fermentation brewed by Moortgat.

We think we\u2019ve met that goal, & hope you\u2019ll agree.\r\n\r\nAt Aftershock, we believe there are two different approaches to brewing.  The most common approach used by the major breweries is a \u2018scientific one\u2019.  All stages of the brewing process are closely monitored to ensure a consistent, if tasteless product.  Computers and other high tech equipment are more in control than the brewer himself.  With this approach you get \u2018scientific\u2019 beer.  The other approach is a more artistic one, while still respecting basic laws of science, and the need for spotless cleanliness.  That\u2019s the approach we plan to always take at Aftershock.  At the risk of losing an undetectable amount of consistency, the result is beer with much more character, subtle nuances, and awesome flavor.

From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_32dIr0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_32dIr0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_32dIr0-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2013-08-09 19:04:06","id":"krIs45","streetAddress":"5429 Shaune Drive","locality":"Juneau","region":"Alaska","postalCode":"99801","phone":"907-780-5866","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  8:00am - 5:00pm\nTue:  11:00am - 5:00pm\n\nBusiness hours:\r\n8 a.m. - 5 p.m., Monday - Friday\r\n\r\nGift shop and tour hours:\r\nWinter Hours: October - April: 11 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., Tuesday - Saturday\r\nSummer Hours: May - September: 11 a.m. - 6 p.m., 7 days a week","latitude":58.3570171,"longitude":-134.4893459,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2014-08-25 19:12:27","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"NxRmqR","name":"Albquell Br\u00e4uhaus","website":"http:\/\/www.albquell-brauhaus.de\/","established":"1851","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:17:18","updateDate":"2012-08-15 13:29:35","id":"Asc8GM","streetAddress":"Lindenplatz 6","region":"Trochtelfingen","postalCode":"D-72818","latitude":48.308365,"longitude":9.245219,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-15 13:30:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}

We love beer and love sharing our beers with friends and that's what our style of brewing is all about. It's about camaraderie and the group experience. We provide brews for the table that everyone can gather around; brews perfect for the meal you're about to have or the story about to be shared - brews for celebrations and brews for collaboration - we brew for you.","website":"http:\/\/www.acbcnyc.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wlbqd0\/upload_beMRZx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wlbqd0\/upload_beMRZx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wlbqd0\/upload_beMRZx-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-28 13:04:07","updateDate":"2014-03-28 13:04:07","id":"PqZZ9S","streetAddress":"96 Avenue C","locality":"East Village","region":"New York","postalCode":"10009","phone":"(646) 422-7103","website":"http:\/\/www.acbcnyc.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Fri:  12:00pm - 2:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\n\nSun thru Thu: 12 noon to 12 midnight\r\nFri & Sat: 12 noon to 2 am","latitude":40.7236156,"longitude":-73.9788459,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-28 13:05:25","updateDate":"2014-08-25 19:12:36","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"vDxSPd","name":"Alpine Beer Company","description":"Alpine Beer Company opened its doors in the fall of 2002.

This process implies that a natural sediment may remain in the bottle. This sediment can easily be consumed, but if an aesthetic beer experience is desired, pour the beer gently into the glass without the sediment.

From start to finish, he is a one-man operation. The former cabinetmaker is also a self-reliant Mainer through and through. He was originally an all-grain homebrewer who decided to take it to the next level when his friends expressed interest in his beers. He designed the 12-barrel brewing system himself and enlisted a local welder to help put it together. Hazen notes that when you live in Maine, you have to find some service to provide to others in order to survive. For him, brewing is the service he provides to his local community. Located in the rolling hills of Lincolnville, Maine, Andrew's is housed in a renovated farmhouse next to Hazen's home. Finding the brewery is more than half the battle. Have no fear, however, as everyone knows about Andrew's. Also, be aware that due to some thieving souls, the brewery no longer has any signage to announce its existence to the visiting public. The only indication that a brewery exists in the farmhouse are the occasional keg deliveries in Hazen's front yard. And Hazen hasn't been quick to replace the sign either. While he welcomes visitors, you have to remember to clear a path for the busy brewer. Like many other unsung small brewers, running his 5OO-barrel per year brewery is a seven day a week operation for Hazen. Watching Hazen run the brewery is a little like watching Willy Wonka run the Chocolate Factory. When I visit him during a bottling day, Hazen runs between the bottling line and the packaging supplies in a hurried yet methodical manner. He stands up bottles on the line, starts the machine, slides his way across the brewhouse to the packaging materials, and hand assembles the six-packs that will hold the soon-to-be bottled beer. Andrew's beer is straightforward, unassuming and entirely enjoyable. His product line includes the St. Nick Porter, the Northern Brown Ale, the English Pale Ale, and the summer seasonal Ruby's Golden Ale. A celebration of the Amarillo hop, Hazen's English Pale Ale is a delightfully balanced product that neither over or underwhelms the palate.  from beerscribe.com","website":"http:\/\/mainebrewersguild.org\/brewers\/andrews-brewing-company\/","established":"1992","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-06-20 12:27:36","id":"TaDE9V","streetAddress":"353 High St","locality":"Lincolnville","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04849","phone":"(207) 763-3305","website":"http:\/\/www.mainebrewersguild.org\/andrews.php","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  7:00am - 4:00pm\nTue:  7:00am - 4:00pm\nWed:  7:00am - 4:00pm\nThu:  7:00am - 4:00pm\nFri:  7:00am - 4:00pm\nSat:  9:00am - 10:00am\n\nMon - Fri: 7:00 am - 4:00 pm\r\nSat: 9:00 am - 10:00 am","latitude":44.3139494,"longitude":-69.1336523,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1992","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-08-25 19:12:47","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"SYkdNz","name":"Andrews Brewing Company","description":"Located in the town's first jail at Calaboose Cellars.","website":"http:\/\/www.andrewsbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/SYkdNz\/upload_utqBLL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/SYkdNz\/upload_utqBLL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/SYkdNz\/upload_utqBLL-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-04 16:31:47","updateDate":"2014-01-25 13:40:03","id":"q36J9G","name":"Andrews Brewing Company","streetAddress":"565 Aquone Road","extendedAddress":"P.O.

We are committed to the continued growth and revitalization of our neighborhood by being an interactive and supportive partner to the arts and business communities, as well as the burgeoning craft beer movement in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nAngel City Brewing was founded in 1997. Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became \u0003a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the \u0003facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA\u2019s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great \u0003city a great brewery.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nSince January 2012, we\u2019ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out. In addition to the neighborhood cuisine, our parking lot has become a hot spot for food trucks, with one parked outside nearly every night we\u2019re open. On May 5th, 2013 we had our grand opening with our first ever Heritage Festival. We\u2019re now seven days a week for brewery tours and tastings, and we have full roster of weekly events.","website":"http:\/\/www.angelcitybrewing.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_6I5iTE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_6I5iTE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_6I5iTE-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

While most of it goes into cask, you'll also find it in keg or bottle if you look in the right places.","website":"http:\/\/arborales.co.uk\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3CT0MA\/upload_TQKReY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3CT0MA\/upload_TQKReY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3CT0MA\/upload_TQKReY-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-08 08:41:02","updateDate":"2013-05-09 00:46:29","id":"pguslr","streetAddress":"Unit 4 Lawrence Hill Industrial Park","extendedAddress":"Croydon Street","locality":"Lawrence Hill","region":"Bristol","postalCode":"BS5 0EB","latitude":51.4583567,"longitude":-2.5694249,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-09 00:37:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"S0dgvI","name":"The Old Stillage","streetAddress":"147 Church Rd","extendedAddress":"Redfield","locality":"Bristol","postalCode":"BS5 9LA","phone":"0117 939 4079","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nTue:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 10:30pm\n\nMon-Thu 4pm-11pm;\r\nFri 4pm-12am;\r\nSat 12pm-12am;\r\nSun 12pm-10:30pm","latitude":51.4586634,"longitude":-2.5581766,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-09 00:40:12","updateDate":"2014-08-25 19:12:59","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"4KMV4j","name":"The Three Tuns","streetAddress":"78 Saint George's Road","extendedAddress":"Hotwells","locality":"Bristol","postalCode":"BS1 5UR","phone":"0117 907 0689","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nTue:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nWed:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nThu:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  4:00pm - 10:30pm\n\nMon-Thu 12pm-2.30pm & 4pm-11pm;\r\nFri-Sat 12pm-12am;\r\nSun 4pm-10:30pm","latitude":51.4511176,"longitude":-2.6049702,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-09 00:41:57","updateDate":"2014-08-25 19:13:00","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"N0HzAh","name":"Arbor Brewing Company","description":"Our love affair with beer began in 1991 with our first batch of homebrew.

His vision of becoming a unique brewer in a competitive business is a success story in the creation of \"Alien Head Beer\", which is now known worldwide.  He started very small, but is now growing at an unbelieveable pace, thanks to a lot of hard work finally paying off and a lot of prayers being answered.   Says Mike: \"Initially, I decided to make everything from scratch because I couldn't afford to buy whatI needed.  Once I made a 1932 yellow deuce coupe in my garage and it became a beautiful running hot rod.  A buddy of mine told me \"If I could do that, then I could make a brewery come true!\"  That really stuck with me.  Little Area 51 Craft Brewery takes a chance in a worldwide market and it was a good choice according to an ever growing popularity.  Why Alien Head Beer? Earthly beers are brewed somewhat similar ways and have a common process.  Alien Head Beer is actually brewed in a special process that is unlike other breweries and delivers a taste that is out of this world!  \"We're already thinking ahead and out of the box of what may come next.

,{"id":"iQmBa8","name":"Auburn Alehouse","description":"A recent addition to Old Town Auburn, the Auburn Alehouse Brewery and Restaurant is located in the historic American Block Building at 289 Washington Street in Old Town Auburn, California. You may better remember the building as the former home of the Shanghai Restaurant and bar, where scenes from the movie, Phenomenon were filmed.\r\n\r\nThe ambiance of the Auburn Alehouse combines the charm and character of this historic brick and mortar building with the bold industrial elements of a gleaming 10-barrel microbrewery.\r\n\r\nGuests and friends can enjoy lunch, dinner, and libation while watching the freshly crafted beer they are drinking being produced just a few feet away.\r\n\r\nThere is also an outdoor patio with a great view of the historic Auburn courthouse. There are always at least 6-8 beers on tap and Hard Cider and select \"guest\" craft beers are also available on draught. Interestingly, the Auburn Alehouse is located just 1\/10th of a mile from the original Auburn Brewery, which brewed for thirsty Auburnites from 1855 until 1908. You may stop by for the ale, but you\u2019ll find the food is a star attraction as well. Whether you\u2019re in the mood for pub fare or a sit down dinner, there is something for every one at the Alehouse.","website":"http:\/\/www.auburnalehouse.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iQmBa8\/upload_iQ9Qyg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iQmBa8\/upload_iQ9Qyg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iQmBa8\/upload_iQ9Qyg-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:11","id":"UOmjKJ","streetAddress":"289 Washington Street","locality":"Auburn","region":"California","postalCode":"95603","phone":"530-885-2537","website":"http:\/\/www.auburnalehouse.com\/","latitude":38.8949179,"longitude":-121.078789,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"E8C6fp","name":"August Schell Brewing Company","description":"The August Schell Brewing Company is a brewing company in New Ulm, Minnesota.

Ayinger beers have been frequent award winners in international beer competitions.\r\n\r\nFor some years, a range of beer was brewed under the Ayingerbrau name by Samuel Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, United Kingdom. Although the Ayinger logo was used, the recipes and range were different from those of the Ayinger Brewery. The arrangement ended in spring 2006, at which point Samuel Smith's rebranded the beers. Distribution of the Ayinger range of beer followed that summer. Because the Oktoberfest in Munich does not allow breweries outside its city limits to participate, Ayinger Brewery organizes many smaller festivals in the countryside around Munich.","website":"http:\/\/en.ayinger-bier.de\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_nCGsoa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_nCGsoa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_nCGsoa-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-28 16:51:35","updateDate":"2013-12-18 12:58:20","id":"eqCbpj","streetAddress":"M\u00fcnchner Stra\u00dfe 21","region":"Aying","postalCode":"D-85653","phone":"49080958890","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-07 20:47:32","updateDate":"2014-10-07 20:47:32","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"qCeB9c","name":"Aztec Brewing Company","description":"ABC.

Starting from this tradition, we bake, as first malt bakery in the world, all our own malts ourselves. It concerns here new kinds of malt that we develop especially for each beer individually. They are unique and baked according to traditional methods.\r\n\r\nWe create our own beer recipes that we brew according to the principle of the gipsy-brewery. This means that we hire the wort boilers of a brewery to brew our own beer. We are convinced that not the kettles determine the taste of the beer, but on the contrary the malt baker and the brewing master.\r\n\r\nThe Triporteur beers are our point of departure and our basic beers. Besides those, we also launch a special beer line with once-off products.

He eventually moved Back East to Connecticut in 2000, with the dream of someday operating a Craft brewery. As a Professional Engineer, Edward enjoys the technical aspects of brewing. Tony developed his appreciation for Craft beer during his college years in Vermont, and always imagined launching a brewery. An entrepreneur at heart and a CPA with extensive experience in accounting, auditing, and insurance, Tony loves building a successful business from the ground up. Tony and Edward began homebrewing and experimenting with different recipes in early 2006, and immersed themselves in all things Craft beer. \r\n\r\nOver this time, we have developed several exciting recipes that we are proud to put the Back East name on.

With 2 offerings currently distributed throughout the state, Back Forty is the only Alabama based brewery that can be found anywhere from Muscle Shoals to Mobile.\r\n\r\nThe name Back Forty Beer Company is basically a reference to the back 40 acres of the farm. Tradionally the \"Back 40\" of a farm is the most challenging to maintain, but also produces some of the best yields due to the rich content of the earth. Likewise, Alabama was one of the last States in The Union to update it's outdated beer laws (MS is the only one left), and now it's time to reap those yields.\r\n\r\nThe craft beer market in Alabama has a lot of room to grow, and we plan on doing everything we can to make that happen. Our main goal is to focus on the local community and support other small business owners while offering up our tasty flavors for the people of Alabama. \r\n\r\nThe company is founded in Alabama, and just about every aspect of this business is supported by Alabama based suppliers. We've worked with a Design firm out of Athens, AL on our label and logos, our attorney is in Birmingham, our accountant is in Dothan, AL, our shirts are printed in Huntsville and our Brewmaster is out of Montgomery, AL. \r\n\r\nWe've been working with Jamie Ray (A nationally recognized Brewmaster who has won several medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, CO), for over a year on our first offering, \"Naked Pig Pale Ale\". And we have several ideas in the works for additional year round offerings in the coming months. We're looking forward to producing some great beers that Alabamian's have never tasted before. Once things get up and running, we'll start releasing some seasonal offerings, one-time offerings, limited edition batches, etc. That's what we're really excited about.\r\n\r\nThe only aspect of this operation that isn't planted firmly in Alabama soil, is the production and packaging. We had to go to another craft brewery in a neighboring state for our first production batches. This is partially due to the enormous start-up costs associated with building a complete brewery operation from scratch. But it's also given us the opportunity to support another regional micro-brewery while we get up and running.","website":"http:\/\/www.backfortybeer.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_Lw3eGZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_Lw3eGZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_Lw3eGZ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2013-03-21 16:54:19","id":"lAcrbq","streetAddress":"200 North 6th St.","locality":"Gadsden","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35901","phone":"256-467-4912","website":"http:\/\/www.backfortybeer.com\/","latitude":34.015484,"longitude":-86.005585,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"w2WxaR","name":"Back Road Brewery","description":"\"We put LaPorte on the beer Map\"\r\n\r\n\"Small brewery big beers\"","website":"http:\/\/www.backroadbrewery.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w2WxaR\/upload_c4Y5Rl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w2WxaR\/upload_c4Y5Rl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w2WxaR\/upload_c4Y5Rl-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-02-04 02:24:05","id":"NULflH","streetAddress":"310 Perry Street","locality":"LaPorte","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46350","phone":"1-219-362-7623","website":"http:\/\/www.backroadbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  4:00pm - 6:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 6:00pm\nSat:  1:00pm - 4:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 4:00pm\n\nThurs - Fri: 4:00 to 6:00 PM\r\nSaturday 1:00 to 4:00 PM\r\nSunday 2:00 to 4:00 PM","latitude":41.6120972,"longitude":-86.7265462,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:33:43","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"Lbvvk1","name":"Back Street Brewery","description":"Our neighborhood brewpubs bring together Lamppost Pizza's award winning pizza with the freshest handcrafted ales and lagers.\r\n\r\nOur brewmasters use traditional brewing methods along with the finest imported ingredients available.

We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_NaZDit-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_NaZDit-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_NaZDit-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2014-09-19 18:12:16","id":"PckBjw","name":"Home Brew Mart","streetAddress":"5401 Linda Vista Road","extendedAddress":"#406","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92110","phone":"(619) 295-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tasting Room & Store Hours\r\nMonday-Friday, 11:00-7:00\r\nSaturday-Sunday, 10:00-5:00","latitude":32.7667586,"longitude":-117.1952129,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:33:49","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"a7VHpi","streetAddress":"10051 Old Grove Rd","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92131","phone":"(858) 695-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","latitude":32.898466,"longitude":-117.110794,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-07 00:05:42","updateDate":"2014-10-13 14:28:49","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"cLcfTf","name":"Tasting Room & Kitchen","streetAddress":"2215 India St","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92101","phone":"(619) 255-7213","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nTue:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nSun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\n\nMon\u2013Fri 11:00am\u201311:00pm\r\nSaturday 11:00am\u201311:00pm\r\nSunday 11:00am\u20139:00pm","latitude":32.7277143,"longitude":-117.1697202,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:03:59","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:33:51","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"dhb4pP","name":"Ballyhoo Brewing Company","description":"The Ballyhoo Brewing Company is a new craft brewery located on the Texas Gulf Coast.

He supplied Ngoma from Togo, Flame from New Zealand, and Lapin Kulta from Finland.   One day Wolfgang asked Stephen if he would like to make a beer in Germany and using an American marketing theme.  It took Stephen just a second to say yes and a day to come up with The Raven.

Barley and Vine is becoming known for great quality ales, and at times going to extremes to provide the very best in beer.\r\n\r\nFrom the first batch of beer, Rambler Red, brewing was destined for the garage or outdoors because of the huge mess and bad smell made in the kitchen. So, for the first four years Barley and Vine was making 5-gallon extract batches.  Barley and Vine began sharing the beers with friends and family looking for input and making corrections and changes when needed.  As time went by the brewing skill level and quality of the beer continued to improve.   Changing from 5-gallon extract batched to 10 gallon all-grain batches made a huge difference in the quality of the final product.\r\n\r\nBarley and Vine is a nano brewery in the planning.  As we continue to build our business plan, determine a location, and perfect our recipes and processes we will do our best to keep people up to speed through this website, Facebook, and our blog.

After that trip, the direction of the brewery was set. German beer had to be re-discovered by the population. After many discussions on opening a brewery and a trip to Germany, the dream became reality. We found an existing brewery to purchase - Lunar Brewing. After purchasing Lunar and getting approved for all the necessary licensing, Baron is ready to go. On June 14th, the world of Seattle will have the chance to finally taste and purchase Baron Beer. The first style of many to be released is our flagship beer - Munich Lager.That is all for the history.

Brewed and bottled in small batches with only honest ingredients, BarrelHouse beers are extremely fresh and exceptionally flavorful. Thank you for embracing our fiercely independent vision of a hand-crafted future for all! Operating as a brewpub from August 1995 until February 2005, The BarrelHouse Brewing Company recently relocated to our current location in the West End of downtown Cincinnati. We officially reopened with a completed expansion plan in April 2005. Our expansion included almost doubling our fermentation capacity as well as the addition of a brand new bottling line. Our first order of bottled beer hit Ohio area stores in June 2006 and we have subsequently begun to enter markets that were previously unavailable. The BarrelHouse Brewing Company brews on a 15 BBL brewhouse manufactured by Century. One BBL equals 31 gallons therefore; our beers are hand-crafted in 465 gallon batches. Our ales are ready after approximately fourteen days while our lagers are conditioned for upwards of six weeks. By brewing in small batches, our brewers are able to achieve an optimal level of quality control while creating a consistently flavorful product. While our brewing process is quite labor intensive, we believe that hand-crafting our beers sets us apart from the majority of breweries in the U.S. today. Our dedication is unparalleled and quite evident in the final packaged product.","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2012-04-30 16:01:12","id":"iWyq08","streetAddress":"544B W.

This majestic white oak stands in the middle of where the road would have gone, if not for this tree\u2019s historical significance.

Colonel Juan Batista de Anza led more than 240 men, women and children on an overland journey from the frontier New Spain to settle in Alta California. During that 1,200 mile journey, the very thirsty Colonel carved the cross to signify the perfect location for a brewery\u2026well, that\u2019s our story at Barrelhouse and we can\u2019t exactly prove it, but we\u2019re sticking to it!

The brewery, which occupies 9,000 square feet at 429 W. 3rd St in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, was founded by Mike Hiller in July 2007.  Though a native of South Williamsport, Barbarian Chief, Mike Hiller, first entered the craft brewing industry in 1997 as an Account Services Associate for Legendary Distributors, Ltd., of Richmond, Virginia. After nearly a year of distributing beer, an opportunity arose for Mike to work as a brewer for Legend Brewing Company. Mike worked with five other brewers to perform duties at all levels of production including brewing, cellar work, cleaning and maintenance.  After nearly four years of service at Legend Brewing Company, Mike moved to Boston, MA, so his wife, Kira, could attend grad school. Tired of listening to him whine about how much he missed brewing, Kira gave him a home brewing kit as an anniversary gift. Mike began brewing whenever he could find the time. He developed the recipes for Hammerin' Ale, Headbangerz Brown Ale, Square Feet Wheat, Weldspatter I.P.A. and several other beers in five-gallon batches on his apartment's balcony.  Mike was also commissioned by friends and co-workers to brew beer for special occasions.  In fact, Square Feet Wheat was actually first brewed for an art gallery opening featuring works by the Barbarian's logo and label designer, Erick Thomas.  After reading Brewing Up a Business: Adventures in Entrepreneurship by Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head Brewery fame, Mike was inspired to start his own brewery. He spent eight months researching and writing a business plan. Another year was spent gathering support and revising his business plans. Thanks to the support of family, friends and other area businessmen who believed in Mike's dream, Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company is now a reality.","website":"http:\/\/www.bavarianbarbarian.com","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:03","id":"bcXmR6","streetAddress":"429 W. 3rd St","locality":"Williamsport","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17701","phone":"570.332.5050","website":"http:\/\/www.bavarianbarbarian.com","latitude":41.238187,"longitude":-77.009056,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"v7knzd","name":"Baxter Brewing Company","description":"Baxter Brewing Company is the first craft brewery in New England to can its entire line of beers.

Ever since the beginnings of the American Beer Renaissance, I have wanted to brew my own great tasting beer and make it available to the beer drinking public and help people learn about and appreciate beer. Coming from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, beer brewing is in my veins.\r\n\r\nTwelve years ago my wonderful wife bought me the \"everything but the kitchen sink\" homebrew kit and it all started. After a few extract brew sessions, I built a 15 gallon brew sculpture and graduated to all-grain brewing, and things really got serious. Now after over 200 brews, BCB is in business!\r\n\r\nThe brewery is small, we call it a Nano-Brewery, we are hidden in the middle of 38 acres of woods in the heart of North Carolina. Most everything is recycled or made in-house. The Brew-House is an old 20' steel cargo container, the Beer-Garden brew patio is recycled flagstone and granite, nestled under spreading oaks and pines, our cooling water is stored rain water from a cistern, the chickens just love the spent mash. All the ingredients are as fresh as possible, some are even home grown. American malts, hops, and yeast are the mainstay of our beers. The water is from our 450' well and is just as pure and clean as can be. Our small batch brewing lets us assure you that each keg or bottle of beer will be as fresh and wonderful as though we were brewing it for ourselves to drink.","website":"http:\/\/www.bearcreekbrews.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:55:26","updateDate":"2014-03-21 12:55:26","id":"EfLTd6","streetAddress":"10538 NC 902 Hwy","locality":"Bear Creek","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27207","phone":"(919) 200-3930","website":"http:\/\/www.bearcreekbrews.com\/","latitude":35.6518126,"longitude":-79.3329623,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:56:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"qz4HmX","streetAddress":"10538 NC 902 Hwy","locality":"Bear Creek","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27207","phone":"(919) 200-3930","website":"http:\/\/www.bearcreekbrews.com\/","latitude":35.6518126,"longitude":-79.3329623,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:56:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"5tw2Iw","name":"Bear Republic Brewing Company","description":"Bear Republic's brews are hand-crafted using traditional brewing methods.

Due to the growing success and demand for Harviestoun Ales, the brewery moved to a new purpose built 60 barrel plant, 5 miles away in Alva, in 2004. Alva was chosen as the location as this allowed us to carry on using the outstanding soft water from the Ochil Hills.\r\n\r\nHarviestoun Brewery was later bought by Caledonian Brewery in 2006. However, in the wake of the acquisition of Caledonian brewing Company by Scottish & Newcastle UK, the brewery became independent once again in 2008 by three noble shareholders who sought to preserve the status as an independent award-winning micro-brewery. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Harviestoun is going through some new and exciting changes to expand the brewery. We are working hard to increase production, while insuring that we still outputting nothing but quality beer. Please look forward to keeping up to date with us on our progress and exciting new changes to our product range.","website":"http:\/\/www.harviestoun-brewery.co.uk\/","established":"1983","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ix655q\/upload_1f95X0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ix655q\/upload_1f95X0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ix655q\/upload_1f95X0-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2013-05-10 18:12:05","id":"sAmmqA","streetAddress":"Hillfoots Business Village","locality":"Alva Industrial Estate Alva, Central","region":"Scotland","postalCode":"FK12 5DQ","phone":"44-(01259)-769100","website":"http:\/\/www.harviestoun-brewery.co.uk\/","latitude":56.15306,"longitude":-3.798604,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","yearOpened":"1985","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"dd42Ca","name":"Haskell Brewing, LLC","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:17","id":"UUVazb","locality":"Haskell","region":"New Jersey","latitude":41.029055,"longitude":-74.296833,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"tICUo1","name":"Hasser\u00f6der","website":"http:\/\/hasseroeder.de\/","established":"1872","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:20:19","updateDate":"2012-08-16 13:06:46","id":"I6NBN9","streetAddress":"Auerhahnring 1","locality":"Wernigerode","postalCode":"38855","phone":"49-(0)3943-\/-9360","latitude":51.845715,"longitude":10.755037,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-16 13:07:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"M2AbzX","name":"Hauff Brauerei","website":"http:\/\/www.hauff-braeu.com\/","established":"1493","isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-30 08:25:37","updateDate":"2013-08-30 12:49:14","id":"LqF5uF","name":"Headquarter","streetAddress":"Marktplatz 1","locality":"Lichtenau","postalCode":"91586","website":"http:\/\/www.hauff-braeu.com","latitude":51.71356,"longitude":8.93372,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-30 08:28:22","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"wR622m","name":"Hausbierbrauerei Mario Miedl","website":"http:\/\/www.stromberger-urbraeu.de\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:19:38","updateDate":"2012-08-16 13:09:50","id":"B4XeLe","streetAddress":"Deyertstrasse 23b","locality":"Schweppenhausen","region":"Rheinland-Pfalz","postalCode":"55444","latitude":49.928465,"longitude":7.83083,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:47:39","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"3wVSu9","name":"Hausbrauerei Altstadthof","description":"At our historic brewery location in Nuremberg's old city, you can experience traditional beer brewing first-hand.

The town surrounds the U.S. Ramstein Air Force Base.

famous \u201chofbrauhaus\u201d was founded in 1589 by the Duke of Bavaria, Wilhelm V. It is one of Munich's oldest beer halls. It was originally founded as the brewery to the old Royal Residence, which at that time was situated just around the corner from where the beer hall stands today. The beer quickly became world famous thanks to the first brewer, Heimeran Pongratz, and the famous \"Bavarian Beer Purity Law\" of 1516 that stated that only natural ingredients could be used in the brewing process. In fact, the beer became so famous that it once saved the city from annihilation. When King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden invaded Bavaria during the Thirty Years' War in 1632, he threatened to sack and burn the entire city of Munich. He agreed to leave the city in peace if the citizens surrendered some hostages, and 600,000 barrels of Hofbr\u00e4uhaus beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.hofbraeuhaus.de\/","established":"1589","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4rlPFf\/upload_4Q1DyU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4rlPFf\/upload_4Q1DyU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4rlPFf\/upload_4Q1DyU-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

While your \"good\" nature will definitely be aroused by this cool, spirit-raising refreshment, your inner evil will soon begin to feel less inhibited, allowing initial laughter and fun to soon require an internal battle of self-restraint.\r\n\r\nHistory - Since the dawn of mankind, we have struggled with the battle of good and evil. To drown in guilt or sorrow is unhealthy and seen by some as wasted emotions. In opposition, to live our lives completely without impure influence and to be seen by all as \u201cup-tight\u201d without the ability to cut loose on occasion is viewed in equally a negative fashion. Until now, there has never been a respectable or enjoyable solution to this life long struggle.\r\nHolyBrew is a positive channel for cleansing one\u2019s mind, body and spirit of unwanted or unnecessary guilt, doubt or unhappiness.

In developing the best beers and brewing techniques. With roots going back to 1897 Indslev Bryggeri on Funen reopened as a modern brewery in April 2006.\r\n\r\nThe equipment and the raw materials we use are selected to achieve the very best quality. Weissbeer from Indslev Bryggeri has great taste. Every week shops, cafes and restaurants across the country get freshly tapped beer from Indslev - so you can enjoy the best beer in your glass.\r\n\r\nWeissbeer is classic Belgian and German beer tradition dating back to ancient times. And the right person to introduce the German weissbier tradition of Indslev Bryggeri is Brewmaster Stefan Peter Stadler. He has 30 years of experience with Weissbier and the art of brewing beer for the senses. Stefan Peter Stadler was born and raised in Munich, where he is graduated master brewer at Hofbrauhaus in Munich. He has experience in both German and Danish breweries.\r\n\r\nDiscover our interpretation of Danish Weissbier that is hand-brewed by Bavarian tradition. We believe that hand-brewed beer tastes better. The entire brewing process is controlled by hand, and we treat for all the details and the best ingredients. There is no additives - only malt, hops, yeast, water and a few spices.","website":"http:\/\/www.indslevbryggeri.dk","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fOnL38\/upload_BNfCRD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fOnL38\/upload_BNfCRD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fOnL38\/upload_BNfCRD-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-09 19:16:18","updateDate":"2013-01-10 11:30:02","id":"knTrj1","name":"Indslev Bryggeri A\/S","streetAddress":"Store Landevej 13","locality":"Nr. \u00c5by","postalCode":"5580","phone":"64441507","website":"http:\/\/www.indslevbryggeri.dk\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: closed\r\nTuesday: closed\r\nWednesday: closed\r\nThursday: closed\r\nFriday: 14.00 to 17.00\r\nSaturday: 10.00 - 14.00\r\nSunday: closed","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DK","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-09 19:20:26","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Denmark","isoThree":"DNK","numberCode":208,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"zDo8u8","name":"Indus Valley Brewing Company","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:19","id":"gndBEW","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IN","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"India","isoThree":"IND","numberCode":356,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"CQW3hO","name":"Industrias La Constancia ILC","website":"http:\/\/www.laconstancia.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2012-07-04 01:19:55","id":"J7LzNx","streetAddress":"Avenida Independencia No.526","locality":"San Salvador","phone":"503-231-5444","website":"http:\/\/www.laconstancia.com\/","latitude":13.7000445,"longitude":-89.1823366,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"SV","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"El Salvador","isoThree":"SLV","numberCode":222,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"X5IBlf","name":"Industrija Piva I Sokova Trebjesa","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:07","id":"vR4nXO","streetAddress":"Njegoseva 18","locality":"Nikic","phone":"381-83-242-433","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CS","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Serbia and Montenegro","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"uLYwtl","name":"Infamous Brewing Company","description":"The team at IBC hails from a diverse background spanning multiple industries who have settled in ATX from other parts of Texas and from both the East and West Coasts. \r\nWe have been home brewing for quite some time and now we are taking that passion to the next level by offering our creations to as many people as possible.\r\nWe are currently in the initial stages of development and hope to begin production by year end.

It was part of the nominated drinks list for the G8 Summit 2005 at Gleneagles Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe business is, since 2008, family owned following a management buy-out from its original part-owners, William Grant and Sons.\r\n\r\nTheir Innis & Gunn Original beer is brewed in Dunbar, East Lothian before being matured in American white oak Bourbon barrels for 30 days and is then a further 47 days in a marrying tun, and so it is matured for 77 days in total. It is 6.6% alcohol by volume. At first only available as a bottled beer it is now marketed both in bottles and as draught.\r\n\r\nAccording to Innis and Gunn's website, the process was discovered in an ironic accident: the intent was to create a scotch whisky with ale flavours. To do this, a special beer was created which would then be stored in the whisky barrels. After the beer had conditioned the barrels, it was to be discarded and replaced with the whisky. The brewers noted that the process had an agreeable effect on the beer, and thus aging the beer became an end in itself.\r\n\r\nA \"blonde\" version of Innis & Gunn is also widely available, and a limited edition matured in rum barrels was produced.","website":"http:\/\/www.innisandgunn.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_attxYK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_attxYK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_attxYK-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 00:34:11","updateDate":"2012-08-03 12:40:12","id":"0HAazs","streetAddress":"6 Randolph Crescent","region":"Edinburgh","postalCode":"EH3 7TH","phone":"+44 (0) 131 337 4420","website":"http:\/\/www.innisandgunn.com\/","latitude":55.951976,"longitude":-3.211095,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 12:39:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"Y9Mg9A","name":"Innovation Brewing","website":"http:\/\/www.innovation-brewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Y9Mg9A\/upload_4jJvkO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Y9Mg9A\/upload_4jJvkO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Y9Mg9A\/upload_4jJvkO-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-07 20:23:02","updateDate":"2014-01-07 20:25:27","id":"vdiLuR","streetAddress":"414 W Main Street","locality":"Sylva","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28779","phone":"(828) 586-9678","website":"http:\/\/www.innovation-brewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon: Closed\r\nTues - Thurs: 4:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nFri: 4:00pm - 12:00am\r\nSat: 12:00pm - 12:00am\r\nSun: 2:00pm - 11:00pm","latitude":35.3739195,"longitude":-83.2204756,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-07 20:24:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"J3Wz2t","name":"Institution Ale Company","description":"We are a family owned and operated micro-brewery dedicated to crafting uncompromised and unfiltered American style ales.

It had a very mom and pop feel, and featured a look that was as traditional as it gets. Those who knew of it visited regularly, but the regulars were few. For many, the brewery was a thing shrouded in mystery... college students-which comprise a fair percentage of Ellensburg's population for most of the year-would occasionally see a bottle on a store shelf and ask where it came from. The likely response:\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I think some dude makes that in his basement or something...\"\r\n\r\nThe word just wasn't getting out, and things didn't look good for the tiny brewery that made exceptionally tasty ales. \r\nWell, a couple of hoodlums in their late-twenties jumped on the opportunity to own and operate their own brewery, and what resulted is the Iron Horse Brewery you know and love today. They tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good things started to happen. Locals started to dig what the guys were doing. A few bars took a chance and put Iron Horse back on tap, and the beer started flowing. \r\n\r\nThe word started getting out.","website":"http:\/\/www.ironhorsebrewery.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_eun7Ba-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_eun7Ba-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_eun7Ba-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-04-01 15:22:45","id":"xZTJW3","streetAddress":"1000 Prospect Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 4","locality":"Ellensburg","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98926","phone":"509-933-3134","website":"http:\/\/www.ironhorsebrewery.com\/","latitude":46.9994703,"longitude":-120.5648701,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"Ezd2gH","name":"Iron Springs Pub & Brewery","description":"Brewpub in the heart of Marin County.","website":"http:\/\/ironspringspub.com","established":"2004","mailingListUrl":"info@ironspringspub.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ezd2gH\/upload_6neGkP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ezd2gH\/upload_6neGkP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ezd2gH\/upload_6neGkP-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-09-10 16:11:48","id":"ZtC7fU","streetAddress":"765 Center Boulevard","locality":"Fairfax","region":"California","postalCode":"94930","phone":"1-415-485-1005","latitude":37.9861207,"longitude":-122.5839897,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"rqVDmz","name":"Ironclad Brewery","website":"http:\/\/www.ironcladbrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rqVDmz\/upload_LvWQRf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rqVDmz\/upload_LvWQRf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rqVDmz\/upload_LvWQRf-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-29 12:25:52","updateDate":"2014-10-29 12:25:53","id":"QW4z4c","streetAddress":"115 N 2nd St","locality":"Wilmington","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28401","website":"http:\/\/www.ironcladbrewery.com\/","latitude":34.2371341,"longitude":-77.9476488,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-29 12:25:53","updateDate":"2014-10-29 12:25:53","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"KfUAM2","name":"Ironfire Brewing Company","description":"Ironfire Brewing Company was founded in 2011 by John Maino and Gregory Webb.

since July, 2000 and has steadily gained a following of enthusiasts along the Santa Barbara coast. Owner and brewer Paul Wright began his brewing adventures after receiving a homebrew kit for Christmas in 1991 in Novato, CA. He joined the local brew club and started winning awards for his beers. Soon he found himself president and heading up the Marin County State Fair competitions, and after burning out all the burners on the stove, he was banished to brewing outdoors. A certified beer judge, he worked at Marin Brewing Company before starting off on his own, moving south to Carpinteria.

I had always liked my beer, but I realized that there tends to be a brewer\u2019s bias towards their own beer.  A great deal of time and effort goes into making a batch of beer, so the brewer is bound to speak highly of their own goods.  It turns out, I\u2019m my own worst critic.  I\u2019m constantly searching for ways to improve the beer.  Whenever I shared brews with others, they always liked it as well, but who doesn\u2019t like free beer?  For me, the seed was planted quite a few years ago when I started winning homebrewing awards statewide.  It was then I began to realize that I was making more than just pretty good homebrew.  I was making some damn good beer!  I began volunteering to judge at homebrew competitions and making an effort to get out and sample more of the beers not available in northern Minnesota.  I quickly realized that there was much more to explore in the world of beer than I realized.  I studied and tasted everything I could find regarding brewing science and beer styles.  In the midst of all of the studying and research, I took the Beer Judge Certification Program test and obtained a National rank in the BJCP.  I now had some credentials to back up my knowledge of good beer and brewing.  It was clear that this was starting to become more than just a hobby, so I began to put a bit more time and effort into the dream of starting a brewery.\r\n\r\nSo, after all this research and planning, what\u2019s the plan?  Start small.\r\n\r\nJack Pine Brewery is starting very small.  Nanobrewery small.  Brewing forty gallons at a time small.  Did I mention the brewer is small?\r\n\r\nThis little brewery serves as a pilot system for the eventual build-out of a full scale production brewery.

The earliest section was completed in 1890 and was occupied by the Red Andrews Saloon and the Central House Hotel. It was built by August Tiedemann, a noted local builder and architect, for two Swedish brothers, \"Red\" Andrew Johnson and Axel Johnson. It largely served sailors of the Great Lakes during the booming days of logging in Western Michigan.\r\nIn 1892 a second structure with decorative cast iron columns was added.(Now, entrance to Sunset Bay Antiques.) It served as the lobby of the Central House Hotel and provided a dining room, upstairs parlor rooms and additional bedrooms.\r\nIn 1905 the final four storefronts were added to provide apartments for the employees of the recently completed Star Watch Case Co., then located on nearby Rath Street. The ground level store-fronts of the buildings have been used for a wide variety of trades over the past 120 plus years, including a butcher shop, a millinery, a theatorium, a dry cleaners, a hardware store, a clothing shop, various furniture stores, the State Liquor Control Commission store, a bicycle shop, the local headquarters for the National Maritime Union, and currently, Sunset Bay Antiques and Jamesport Brewing Company","website":"http:\/\/www.jamesportbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2000","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_hLzwCi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_hLzwCi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_hLzwCi-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2012-07-16 11:45:34","id":"nCojAV","streetAddress":"410 James Street","locality":"Ludington","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49431","phone":"231-845-2522","website":"http:\/\/www.jamesportbrewingcompany.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu:\r\n11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\n11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\n\r\nFri - Sat:\r\n11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\n11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\n\r\nSun:\t\r\n11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\n12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":43.9523739,"longitude":-86.4478298,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"oE1miM","name":"Jamul Brewing Co.","description":"Jamul's Local Brewery is now serving our community's restaurants and pubs!!

Huber Brewing Company was set in motion in 1984 with the dreams of Missouri farmboy John Huber as he tasted his first home-brewed beer. In 2003, John received a home-brew kit for Christmas from his wife and sons. It was at that moment the Huber Brew or \"Hubrew\", the Company's flagship beer, was born. In 2009, he opened up Homebrew Supply of Southeast Missouri, LLC in Jackson, Missouri. In 2011, the John A. Huber Brewing Company took root in Fruitland, Missouri. The Company is a family owned and operated business. John's sons, Matthew and Chad, assist their father in the Company's operation. John and his family have lived in Southeast Missouri all their lives. They want to share their passion for brewing, their sense of community and their comradery. Come join them.\"\r\n\r\nHubrew is a packaging brewery.

In 1918, the name was changed to a Lithuanian equivalent of Bergschl\u00f6sschen, Kalnapilis.\r\n\r\nKalnapilis was taken over by Baltic Beverages Holding (established by Pripps of Sweden and Hartwall of Finland) in 1994. Ownership passed to Royal Unibrew in 2001, which merged the Kalnapilis with Tauras brewery in Vilnius into AB Kalnapilio-Tauro Grup?.\r\n\r\nIn April 1996, new fermentation and storage equipment enabled significantly different processing, the result being the introduction of three new brands.

This led to many beer pilgrimages by this writer to Peterborough to satisfy my thirst.\r\n\r\nLuckily, Kawartha Lakes now distributes their Raspberry Wheat and Cream Ale in 12-packs in a growing number of Beer Stores. Due to the immense popularity of KLB beers, their Nut Brown Ale will also be available in Beer Stores beginning in September. Drinkers who desire their fine Pale Ale must still trek up to Central Ontario, but hopefully this brew will follow sometime in the future and round out their slate.\r\n\r\nKawartha Lakes was recently written up in the National Post, with the headline on March 8 reading: \"The last thing thriving Kawartha Lakes Brewing needs is more customers\".

His family was collecting rice from farmers as land taxes for the Mito Tokugawa family. He began his brewery with the idea of using the remaining rice stocks in the warehouse. At this time in Japan a new political movement began to reform the Tokugawa regime. Fujita Toko, one of the movement's activists, advocated an ideology to build a new organizational government with a reverence of the emperor, and his thought led to the Meiji Restoration.\r\n\r\nFujita was a close friend of Kiuchi, who named one of his sakes \"KIKUSAKARI\" as a respect to the emperor. KIKU (chrysanthemum) is a crest of the imperial household, and SAKARI means 'property'.\r\n\r\n1950's Mikio Kiuchi inherited the brewery legacy in 1950. It was the time when the sake industry flourished as the rapid growth of Japan's economy after the World War II. Although many sake breweries started mass producing low quality sake due to increased demand, Kiuchi Brewery maintained their policy of pursuing the best quality of sake with the optimum ingredients and craftsman-ship.\r\n\r\nHitachino Beer In autumn 1996, Kiuchi started beer brewing business, named the brand \"HITACHINO NEST BEER\" with unique owl character logo.\r\nOver the years, Kiuchi Brewery has gained Japan and worldwide attention by winning awards at numerous world beer competitions.\r\nIn 2000, Brew on Premises facilities has opened to introduce the Lager is the main stream in the beer industries in Japan.\r\n\r\nShochu Kiuchi Kiuchi built a Distillation facility in March, 2003. to aid with recycling and reduction of waste, beginning with the production of \"Shochu Kiuchi\" Distilled liquor made from Sakekasu (Sake lees) which is the by-product of Sake Brewing.\r\n\r\nThe wine brewing project is the latest challenge of Kiuchi Brewery. Kiuchi bought 4000 square meters of land next to the brewery for the vineyard. The grape seedlings, Merlot and Chardoney were imported from France. The vineyard produced its first crop in 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, 3 tonnes of grapes were harvested producing 2000 Litres of Wine. This wine is hoped to be able to offer on a market as another prestigious Kiuchi brand in the near future...","website":"http:\/\/www.kodawari.cc\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_RGrlo5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_RGrlo5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_RGrlo5-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

Creativity is something we value in our Ales and it\u2019s our goal to incorporate regional ingredients into beers that go beyond convention. Brewing to style is not our objective; we prefer to focus our explorations on the potential of beer.\r\n\r\nBut we\u2019re more than just brewing, we\u2019ve got good food to boot. The Prodigal Son features a menu that combines traditional pub fare with scratch cooking. Here you will find regional ingredients incorporated into handcrafted cuisine.

He has been homebrewing since the 90\u2032s, and has graduated from the American Brewers Guild with a Craft Brewers Apprenticeship (CBA) in 2010. He apprenticed at the Real Ale Brewery in Blanco, and began brewing at the Root Cellar in 2012. The house beers brewed by Robert are Alison\u2019s Ale, Cream Steam, Santa Fe Stout, and a Gluten Free IPA.\r\n\r\nAlison\u2019s Ale - A highly complex, clean and refreshing taste with a blend of six different malts and three different hops.\r\n\r\nCream Steam - Steam Beers are in a category all their own. Is it a lager? Is it an ale? Actually, it\u2019s a lager brewed at ale temperatures. This higher temperature fermentation produces a beer with more \u201cfruity\u201d qualities than your average lager. The hops are 100% Northern Brewer, but Robert has lowered the hop bill to make this Steam Beer a bit more creamy and smooth.\r\n\r\nSanta Fe Stout \u2013 This dry Stout, moderately bittered with Kent Golding hops, has flavor notes that remind me of a cup of dark coffee sipped from a warm mug on a cold Santa Fe morning.\r\n\r\nGluten Free Beer - Made with Sorghum, Honey, and Hops.","website":"http:\/\/www.rootcellarcafe.com\/brewery\/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/A2N1IN\/upload_Js7GlQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/A2N1IN\/upload_Js7GlQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/A2N1IN\/upload_Js7GlQ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-14 00:53:58","updateDate":"2013-08-18 13:42:18","id":"rkmM7h","streetAddress":"215 North LBJ","locality":"San Marcos","region":"Texas","postalCode":"78666","phone":"512.392.5158","website":"http:\/\/www.rootcellarcafe.com\/brewery\/","latitude":29.883343,"longitude":-97.9401695,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-14 00:54:34","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"OaZYgf","name":"The Round Barn Winery & Brewery","description":"With more than 30 years of fermentation experience and an award-winning reputation in the industry, our line of hand-crafted brews embody the satisfying bold taste you've come to expect from The Round Barn.","website":"http:\/\/www.roundbarnwinery.com\/brewery.php","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2012-04-09 19:04:42","id":"8LAl4e","streetAddress":"10983 Hills Road","locality":"Baroda","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49101","phone":"(800)-716-9463","website":"http:\/\/www.roundbarnwinery.com\/brewery.php","latitude":41.9200132,"longitude":-86.4584191,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"tNDKBY","name":"The Saint Louis Brewery","description":"Schlafly is the brand name of beers produced by the Saint Louis Brewery, Inc.

We truly believe you should follow your passion and enjoy life. How better to do that than open Thirsty Planet Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nOur purpose then morphs into doing the right thing. For us, this includes being environmentally conscious. We have laced filters in our drains for run-off water, so we can use that water to irrigate our lawns and plants. We also plan to purchase solar panels for our brewery. We recycle, and you will quickly learn that after visiting our beautiful tasting room. Check out our bar, you will see what we mean.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of doing the right thing is through charitable donations. We have been truly blessed in life and want to give to those who are in need of a blessing. A portion of our Yellow Armadillo Wheat sales will go to a local cancer research\/support foundation, and a portion of our Thirsty Goat Amber sales will go to help purchase farm animals (maybe goats?) for needy people in third world countries. So, not only can we feel good for helping people, you can feel good every time you purchase Thirsty Planet beer.

They first met in 2005 while going to the University of Minnesota for bachelor degrees in Electrical Engineering. Over time, they all worked together as hardware design engineers for a small engineering services company specializing in RF-centric products. Being young engineers working downtown Minneapolis, they attended various happy hours together. It quickly became clear that they all really loved craft beer and were very intrigued with the science of the brewing process.\r\n\r\nJake and Jeff are the two brewers of the company who designed and honed the recipes. They got their start in 2006 brewing extract kits on Jake's Mom's kitchen stove much to her chagrin. (A few boil-overs did occur on her stove, whoops!) They brewed countless extract kits until in 2010, when after touring Surly and Flat Earth, they were inspired to turn their passion (like the founders of those breweries) into a business. From that point forward it has been all grain brewing and loving it. Nowadays, Jake focuses on the brewing aspect of the business while Jeff focuses on the brewing as well as the business side of the operation.\r\n\r\nGeorge, in the early years, was a force within the brewery by helping out at every brew session and providing needed muscle for cleaning and moving material around the brewhouse. He focused a lot on the quality of our beer and pushed us to design better more complex beers. He has moved on to be in charge of our online presence including developing our own beer wiki engine.","website":"http:\/\/twbrewing.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HhKKA6\/upload_Oo4Qmh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HhKKA6\/upload_Oo4Qmh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HhKKA6\/upload_Oo4Qmh-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 14:09:11","id":"06ughl","name":"Tin Whiskers Brewery and Taproom","streetAddress":"125 E 9th St.","extendedAddress":"Unit 127","locality":"St. Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55101","phone":"(651) 330-4734","website":"http:\/\/twbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wednesday: 4-10PM\r\nThursday 4-10PM\r\nFriday 3-11PM\r\nSaturday 12-11PM","latitude":44.9506615,"longitude":-93.09361,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"32gsol","name":"Tin Whistle Brewing","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:09","id":"cQdUrC","streetAddress":"954 West Eckhardt Avenue","locality":"Penticton","region":"British Columbia","phone":"1-250-770-1122","latitude":49.4943824,"longitude":-119.6099322,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"pz33H9","name":"Tipping Point Tavern","description":"Here at Tipping Point Tavern you will find the finest artisan smoked meats, local beers, good friends and a relaxed atmosphere.

Thank you for checking us out and we hope to serve you soon!","website":"http:\/\/www.treehausbrewery.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bvNzE9\/upload_de9PX1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bvNzE9\/upload_de9PX1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bvNzE9\/upload_de9PX1-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2012-10-23 10:42:41","id":"vKs97O","locality":"Charlottesville","region":"Virginia","phone":"(434) 242-7321","website":"http:\/\/www.treehausbrewery.com\/","latitude":38.03213,"longitude":-78.477529,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"EF6nNa","name":"Treestrike Brewing Co","website":"http:\/\/www.treestrike.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:18","id":"XeaxGp","streetAddress":"1313 Pecos Dr","locality":"Southlake","region":"Texas","postalCode":"76092","phone":"817-372-2500","website":"http:\/\/www.treestrike.com\/","latitude":32.944558,"longitude":-97.173573,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"qYpbX1","name":"Tremont Taphouse","website":"http:\/\/tremonttaphouse.com","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:18","id":"9yJlQG","streetAddress":"2572 Scranton Rd","locality":"Cleveland","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44113","phone":"216-298-4451","website":"http:\/\/tremonttaphouse.com","latitude":41.477143,"longitude":-81.695355,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"Owkz44","name":"Tri-City Brewing Company","description":"Tri City Brewing is located in Bay City, Michigan, in the heart of the Tri Cities.

Think of the Queen Mary [an ocean liner]\u2014 the whole ship goes by and then comes the rudder. And there's a tiny thing at the edge of the rudder called a trim tab. It's a miniature rudder. Just moving the little trim tab builds a low pressure that pulls the rudder around. Takes almost no effort at all. So I said that the little individual can be a trim tab. Society thinks it's going right by you, that it's left you all together. But if you're doing dynamic things mentally, the fact is that you can just put your foot out like that and the whole big ship of state is going to go. So I said, call me Trim Tab.\u201d \r\n\u2013 Buckminster Fuller (Playboy, February 1972)\r\n\r\nSmall actions - Huge positive impact.

We can't wait to share our beer with Charlotte and beyond and look forward welcoming everyone to our spacious tap room very soon.","website":"http:\/\/triplecbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wtU6qB\/upload_5yVoNI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wtU6qB\/upload_5yVoNI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wtU6qB\/upload_5yVoNI-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-12 13:30:28","updateDate":"2012-08-22 12:12:12","id":"Qfcr4y","streetAddress":"2900 Griffith St.","locality":"Charlotte","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28203","phone":"704-372-3212","website":"http:\/\/www.triplecbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"MONDAY - closed \r\nTUESDAY 5 - 9 pm\r\nWEDNESDAY 5 - 9 pm\r\nTHURSDAY 5 - 9 pm\r\nFRIDAY 4 - 9 pm\r\nSATURDAY 2 - 9 pm\r\nSUNDAY 1 - 6 pm","latitude":35.200972,"longitude":-80.869119,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-12 13:32:27","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"EcU2nS","name":"Triple Crossing Brewing Company","description":"Triple Crossing Brewing Company grew out of the love of great beer, and the idea that beer is best enjoyed when shared with friends, straight out of the tap.","website":"http:\/\/www.TripleCrossingBeer.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/EcU2nS\/upload_kGeA7X-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/EcU2nS\/upload_kGeA7X-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/EcU2nS\/upload_kGeA7X-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-10-01 14:08:59","updateDate":"2013-10-02 11:57:20","id":"zn6uPI","streetAddress":"113 S Foushee St","locality":"Richmond","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"23226","phone":"(804) 308-0475","website":"http:\/\/www.triplecrossingbeer.com\/","latitude":37.5415878,"longitude":-77.445504,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-10-02 11:57:02","updateDate":"2014-10-02 17:18:40","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"kMlOin","name":"Triple Digit Brewing Company","description":"Triple Digit is the high gravity brand of Cincinnati's Listermann Brewing Company.

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef\u2019s specials.\r\n\r\nwww.troegs.com","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","established":"1997","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/about_us\/newsletter.aspx","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_3yONkx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_3yONkx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_3yONkx-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-10-02 15:58:31","id":"C6iHOv","streetAddress":"200 E Hersheypark Dr","locality":"Hershey","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17033","phone":"717-232-1297","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\n\nGeneral Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","latitude":40.2972852,"longitude":-76.6428527,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-10-02 18:04:49","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"tYBGlQ","name":"Trois Dames","description":"Passion must be lived and shared.

quest throughout the United States and Europe to talk to brewers and sample classic examples of traditional brewing styles.  In 1978 they began taking formal tasting notes on each new beer they could find.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1990s the Tuppers had tasted and evaluated over 6,000 beers and visited hundreds of breweries.  They had found many excellent beers, but envisioned an ale that no one had made\u2014one that would encompass bold American flavors and traditional European brewing techniques.  They asked Old Dominion Brewing Co., which they felt was one of the very best craft breweries in the country, to work with them to develop this ideal ale.  Tuppers\u2019 Hop Pocket Ale was the result.  \r\n\r\nIn 1997 the Tuppers again worked with the Old Dominion brewers to create Tuppers\u2019 Hop Pocket Pils, based on the Keller or Hefe Pils style of Northern Bavaria, but with a unique American boldness to the flavor.\r\n\r\nThe Tuppers live in Bethesda, Maryland, where Bob teaches history.  Ellie works in Washington as a production editor of scientific books.  The Tuppers still travel and taste beers and now have notes on over 14,000 different brews.","website":"http:\/\/tuppersbeers.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7JTum5\/upload_qUmoG7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7JTum5\/upload_qUmoG7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7JTum5\/upload_qUmoG7-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:09","id":"SsYPgS","streetAddress":"6404 Redwing Road","locality":"Bethesda","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"20817","phone":"301-229-2027","website":"http:\/\/tuppersbeers.com\/","latitude":38.973459,"longitude":-77.127249,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"Oxwo6X","name":"Turkey Hill Brewing Company","description":"Located just minutes from downtown Bloomsburg and Bloomsburg University off of Exit 236 on Interstate 80 and directly adjacent to The Inn at Turkey Hill,  Turkey Hill Brewing Company Pub & Grille offers casual dining in a unique atmosphere as well as some of the area\u2019s best craft beer brewed on site.","website":"http:\/\/turkeyhillbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oxwo6X\/upload_Rh2G1P-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oxwo6X\/upload_Rh2G1P-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oxwo6X\/upload_Rh2G1P-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-02 18:45:38","updateDate":"2012-08-02 20:19:46","id":"9K0AXZ","streetAddress":"991 Central Road","locality":"Bloomsburg","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17815","phone":"570-387-8422","website":"http:\/\/turkeyhillbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon -

Dan started brewing around 1990, using extracts. He took up the hobby in earnest which meant taking over the garage 5 years ago and transitioning to all-grain brewing. Both Dan and Elle love to cook and brewing days became a natural outlet for hosting all days BBQs with family and friends. The 5-gallon kettle over the kitchen stove grew to a half-barrel, propane-fueled brew rig. And the backyard gained a pellet-smoker alongside the Weber grill. That\u2019s what we call going the distance with brewing and charcuterie!\r\n\r\nWith family and friends raving about our creation, it\u2019s time to take it seriously. We entered the 2011 California State Fair and won three medals including first place for our Knock-Out Stout and second place for The Contender \u2013 our Pale Ale. The following year we won first place for our Scottish Ale which we plan on featuring as one of our seasonal brews.\r\n\r\nIn early 2012 we decided to pursue opening our own microbrewery. Our first challenge seemed almost insurmountable: finding a name! We hit trademark snags with our first three names and finally scored with Twelve Rounds.","website":"http:\/\/www.twelveroundsbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hLGKwV\/upload_n6jGiw-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hLGKwV\/upload_n6jGiw-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hLGKwV\/upload_n6jGiw-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-29 17:19:57","updateDate":"2013-03-29 17:19:58","id":"AQE3Sx","streetAddress":"866 57th St.","locality":"Sacramento","region":"California","postalCode":"95819","phone":"(916) 500-1059","website":"http:\/\/www.twelveroundsbrewing.com\/","latitude":38.566033,"longitude":-121.433545,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-29 17:20:33","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"fWfbGJ","name":"Twelve String Brewing Company","description":"Located in Spokane Valley, WA, 12 String Brewing Company marries the brewer\u2019s love of music, especially the 12 string guitar, with his passion for brewing spectacular beer.

It would take 21 years for that initial interest to manifest itself into something drinkable. The spark would come after 9\/11 while he drank homebrewed stout with five of his friends. Motivated by patriotic feelings and the American dream of creating a business, the energy was set in motion to start Twin Lakes Brewing Company. Weeks later, Sam and his longtime friends Matt Day, Jack Wick, and Mark Fesche developed a unique 15 gallon gravity fed pilot system and began working to create their first signature brews.\r\n\r\nThey decided to locate the brewery at the beautiful \u201cTwin Lakes Farm\u201d in Greenville, Delaware. This historic 252 acre farm has been in Sam\u2019s family for seven generations and has a deep rock well aquifer which supplies perfect water for brewing. Local artisans converted an old tractor barn and art studio to accommodate a five vessel, gravity fed brewery and tasting room. Finally, on April 13, 2006, the first two brands, Greenville Pale Ale and Route 52 Pilsner, were launched. \r\n\r\nToday Twin Lakes Brewery also produces Tweed\u2019s Tavern Stout, Caesar Rodney Golden Ale and Winterthur Wheat, as well as seasonal styles Oktoberfest and Jublicious. Currently, Twin Lakes beer is available on tap at many fine restaurants and taverns in Delaware and Southeastern Pennsylvania. Growlers (half gallon jugs of beer) can be purchased at the brewery and kegs are available at most regional beer and liquor stores.","website":"http:\/\/twinlakesbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VcP5iA\/upload_AT5fnN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VcP5iA\/upload_AT5fnN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VcP5iA\/upload_AT5fnN-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2012-04-21 12:38:05","id":"1k3h3N","streetAddress":"4210 Kennett Pike","locality":"Greenville","region":"Delaware","postalCode":"19807","phone":"302-658-1826","website":"http:\/\/twinlakesbrewingcompany.com\/","latitude":39.785885,"longitude":-75.602527,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"s5lxSd","name":"Twin Leaf Brewery","website":"http:\/\/www.twinleafbrewery.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s5lxSd\/upload_cr3g0w-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s5lxSd\/upload_cr3g0w-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s5lxSd\/upload_cr3g0w-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-02 14:32:36","updateDate":"2012-11-02 14:35:11","id":"yJ1zJK","streetAddress":"144 Coxe Avenue","locality":"Asheville","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28801","website":"http:\/\/www.twinleafbrewery.com\/","latitude":35.5894369,"longitude":-82.554528,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-02 14:33:28","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"w3EzsC","name":"Twin Peaks Brewing and Malting Co.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-22 11:36:37","updateDate":"2012-10-22 11:37:22","id":"BJKbGa","streetAddress":"2506 W. 19th St.","locality":"Port Angeles","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98362","website":"(360) 452-2802","latitude":48.121731,"longitude":-123.49474,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-22 11:37:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"woTHSe","name":"Twin Peaks Brewing Co.","description":"Located inside the Twin Peaks restaurant at the N.

After returning to the states, they had trouble finding that type of beer in Chicago so they opened Two Brothers Brewing Company in 1996. To get them started, the brothers' grandfather, a retired dairy farmer, donated his bulk milk tanks, which were quickly converted to fermenters. Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including the Project Opus Sour series. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare. In 2011, the Ebel brothers purchased Walter Payton's Roundhouse located in Aurora, IL. The Two Brothers Roundhouse is a full service brewpub restaurant, music venue, offers banquet space for large parties and weddings and hosts the Two Brothers Cafe and Beer Bar! \r\n\r\nTwo Brothers Brewing Company's award winning products are currently available in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Florida, New York, Iowa and Missouri.","website":"http:\/\/www.twobrosbrew.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_1Io9ak-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_1Io9ak-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_1Io9ak-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-07-29 16:27:37","id":"jeOXxz","name":"Two Brothers Tap House","streetAddress":"30w315 Calumet Ave.","locality":"Warrenville","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60555","phone":"630-393-BEER","website":"http:\/\/www.twobrotherstaphouse.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday        3:00 - 11:00\r\nTuesday        3:00 - 11:00\r\nWednesday   3:00 - 11:00\r\nThursday      3:00 - 11:00\r\nFriday         12:00 - 12:00\r\nSaturday     12:00 - 12:00\r\nSunday        12:00 - 9:00","latitude":41.824906,"longitude":-88.211221,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"YOdPoo","streetAddress":"30W315 Calumet Ave.","locality":"Warrenville","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60555","website":"http:\/\/www.twobrosbrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"We are give tours EVERY Saturday at 1:00 and 2:30 and Sunday at 1:00.","latitude":41.824906,"longitude":-88.211221,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-26 12:57:18","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"AiMDyF","name":"Two Brothers Roundhouse","streetAddress":"205 N.

In the good ole\u2019 days as a young pup, he could be found cruising the college campus at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, body surfin\u2019 at Doggie Beach in Ocean Beach (San Diego), skiing down the snow capped mountains in Ruidoso, New Mexico, relaxing in the Hot Springs of Arkansas and finally making his home in the Valley of the Sun.

Born out of Bear\u2019s  love for craft beer and excellent food, we have created an upbeat, fun atmosphere where friends, family and co-workers can come to enjoy a variety of delicious menu selections & NOW our own locally brewed craft beer. The Uncle Bear\u2019s Brewhouse opened in 2013, as well as the 4 Grill and Bar locations were re-branded to the Grill and Tap concept that same year.\r\n\r\nOn the menu, whenever you see Bear\u2019s paw print  you can be assured the item is a long-term house favorite or a new favorite we are sure Bear would have loved. Try any one of the items from the \u201cFamous\u201d Sliders, Backyard Burgers and Birds, Big Plates and Serious Sizzles, Gourmet Pizza, Bear \u201cBites\u201d or Wing selections and you are in for a true treat.    \r\n\r\nThe unique motif has been designed to resemble all of the places Bear or your family dog would hang out such as the garage, backyard or home.\r\n\r\n In addition to the excellent food menu, we feature fantastic house drinks and NOW a wonderful selection of craft beers brewed on site in our state of the art display brewery. Be sure to try a Flight Bone (5-4oz. tasters) or a Growler (64oz. take-home jug) or a pint of our craft beer.

But what began as a light hobby soon developed into a deep passion. They quickly outgrew the offerings of U-Brew and expanded their operation into a homebrew setup. Fifteen years later, the two Mikes have a lot of batches, awards, and experience under their belts. Starting in May of 2008, Vertigo Brewing was christened a fully-licensed brewery in a Hillsboro warehouse. \r\nVertigo Brewing is currently operating a one barrel system, producing eight to ten barrels a month. But as demand takes off, the two Mikes are eagerly looking forward to an expanded business operation.

Our small size allows us to be nimble and offer tap selections that change frequently.","website":"http:\/\/htto:\/\/www.villageidiotbrewing.com","established":"2013","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/zzc6L","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bSW7g2\/upload_5Gokx4-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bSW7g2\/upload_5Gokx4-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bSW7g2\/upload_5Gokx4-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-20 12:29:58","updateDate":"2014-08-23 16:09:53","id":"PGn0ta","streetAddress":"42 High St","locality":"Mount Holly","region":"New Jersey","postalCode":"08060","phone":"(609) 975-9270","website":"http:\/\/www.villageidiotbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  5:00pm - 9:00pm\nFri:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n","latitude":39.9944079,"longitude":-74.7879478,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-23 16:08:14","updateDate":"2014-08-23 16:08:14","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"Rcmeki","name":"Vilser Bergbr\u00e4u","website":"http:\/\/www.vilserprivatbrauerei.at\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-02 01:38:25","updateDate":"2013-09-02 13:13:07","id":"g4IkyI","streetAddress":"Stadtgasse 2","region":"Vils","postalCode":"6682","phone":"+43(5677) 531 76","website":"http:\/\/www.vilserprivatbrauerei.at\/","latitude":47.5492156,"longitude":10.6300567,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AT","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-02 13:14:11","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Austria","isoThree":"AUT","numberCode":40,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"DBGYX8","name":"Vindication Brewing Co.","description":"A Brewery Founded on the Principles of Craft and Precision, with an Obsession for the Details of Quality, and a Belief in the Power of Beer to Bring People Together.","website":"http:\/\/www.vindicationbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DBGYX8\/upload_9du7zt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DBGYX8\/upload_9du7zt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DBGYX8\/upload_9du7zt-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-01 20:23:22","updateDate":"2014-08-23 14:56:45","id":"pJ3qbH","name":"Brewpub","streetAddress":"6880 Winchester Circle","locality":"Boulder","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80301","website":"http:\/\/www.kettleandstone.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sun: 2:00 pm - 9:00 pm","latitude":40.076775,"longitude":-105.1930579,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-02 12:33:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"eZ20pr","name":"Vine Park Brewing Company","description":"The fun place to brew your own beer and make your wines!\r\n\r\nThe only place in the Midwest where you and friends, co-workers, or even family can meet to create your custom beers & wines.

Armed with a we can do this attitude the three cast off from their careers in engineering and biology to found the Wachusett Brewing Co. in 1993. Wachusett Country Ale was introduced to beer fans of Massachusetts the next year after lots of experimenting to get the formula just right. When Wachusett opened, the three designed and built most of the equipment; did the brewing and filling, selling and delivering, and everything else that a small startup brewery needed. Ned, Kevin and Peter are now backed by some of the most passionate and capable co-workers in the industry. Wachusett Ales continue to be hand crafted with the finest ingredients available, bottled and kegged in our Westminster facility.

This made it impossible for microbreweries or small brewpubs to exist. In 1985 Uli Bennewitz went to his local senator and together they passed a bill allowing microbreweries to sell their own beer on site. A year later on the July 4th, 1986 the Weeping Radish Brewery opened for business. \r\n \r\nRaised in a small village in Bavaria, Uli was determined to bring the high quality beer he was used to across the ocean to North Carolina.

After establishing property for bottling they soon began brewing on what would become the foundations of the Wernesgr\u00fcner Pils Legend. It is known as the aforementioned Pils Legend, because it was a bitter specialty during the communist period in Germany. [1] Throughout the company's history it has endured numerous changes of ownership. In 1762 the G\u00fcnnel family bought the Schorer brewery. In 1774 the M\u00e4nnel family took over the bottling properties. Even though at the end of the 19th century the label now had five independent breweries, the families were still competing with each other. By 1910 the company had established itself throughout Germany and the Netherlands, and was even served on the renowned Hapag-Lloyd ships that ran from Hamburg to America.[1] The company was acquired by the Bitburger Braugruppe GmbH in 2002.

We have chosen to develop extremely high quality, natural beers that will be popular with the sophisticated customers of our time and in our community. We utilized the same process to roll out other Lithia Premium Beers such as Bucky Blonde Ale, arguably the most complex, richest blonde beer ever brewed.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, Lithia Beer will again, and exclusively, be based in West Bend & Washington County, where it belongs. It\u2019s heritage will now continue to benefit our community for hopefully, the next hundred years.

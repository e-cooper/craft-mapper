Oklahoma's largest brewery at 30 barrels (that's 900 gallons at a time), we've been doing it longer than anyone.

In 1857 Swiss born naturalist Armond DuPont wrote, \u201cit is a water like no other, unique in its ability to refresh.\u201d He noted, \u201cThough seemingly impossible, a year-round frost forms at the base of this amazing spring.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe brewery was built at the site of the spring and its water became the basis of all the award winning brews for over 125 years. In addition, the brewery has become the #1 energy drink and specialty drink producer in the country. We personally invite you to explore and enjoy our great water, drinks and brews.","website":"http:\/\/www.coldspringbrewery.com\/","established":"1874","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GhJ5ei\/upload_hmyy4U-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GhJ5ei\/upload_hmyy4U-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GhJ5ei\/upload_hmyy4U-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-07-11 23:28:45","id":"czEE4b","streetAddress":"219 Red River Avenue North","locality":"Cold Spring","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"56320","phone":"320-685-8686","website":"http:\/\/www.coldspringbrewery.com\/","latitude":45.4582465,"longitude":-94.4290551,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"rgFJUs","name":"Coldstream Brewery","description":"At the gateway to the Yarra Valley, Coldstream Brewery is a destination for those who have an appreciation for fine flavours and great beer and cider.","website":"http:\/\/coldstream-brewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rgFJUs\/upload_wu79OO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rgFJUs\/upload_wu79OO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rgFJUs\/upload_wu79OO-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 06:05:31","updateDate":"2014-03-16 14:31:25","id":"67lPiS","streetAddress":"694 Maroondah Highway","locality":"Coldstream","region":"Victoria","postalCode":"3770","phone":"+61 3 9739 1794","website":"http:\/\/www.coldstream-brewery.com.au\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sun: 11:00 am - 11:45 pm","latitude":-37.724435,"longitude":145.379093,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AU","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 14:30:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"Meob53","name":"Cole Street Brewery","description":"Enumclaw's first craft brewery","website":"http:\/\/colestreetbrew.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Meob53\/upload_loBmcq-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Meob53\/upload_loBmcq-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Meob53\/upload_loBmcq-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-26 13:02:37","updateDate":"2013-11-26 13:03:15","id":"MSt4zl","streetAddress":"2551 Cole Street","extendedAddress":"Suite R","locality":"Enumclaw","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98022","phone":"(425) 275-7396","website":"http:\/\/colestreetbrew.com","latitude":47.209929,"longitude":-121.982907,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-26 13:03:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"WGEtq9","name":"College Street Brewhouse & Pub","description":"Just a quick drive to the north side of town, you'll find yourself at Havasu's hippest new brewhouse and pub.

We have been working together for 13 years at Farason Corporation. www.farason.com We became friends quickly due partly for our love of engineering and automation, as well as, our love and passion for craft beers. Our favorite past time has been traveling around visiting craft breweries, brewpubs and taprooms together, along with our wives, for 10 years now. Rod took up home brewing 5 years ago and has become quite proficient at brewing delicious beers to the delight and enjoyment of his colleagues, friends, and family. Rod's talent for brewing and Bill's business experience seemed like a good match for a brewpub that would allow us to continue enjoying Rod's hobby to its fullest extent and share it with many more fellow craft brew enthusiasts. We expect the creation, operation, and continuing evolution of the brewpub to provide us another outlet for our passions by providing a quality product and environment in which to enjoy it, along with meeting and enjoying the company of many people with the same love and passion for high quality craft beer.\r\n\r\nOriginally we looked all over for a good location starting within a few miles of our homes and extending out as far as Columbia hoping for a place within reasonable driving distance from our homes. We believed the market would, to some extent, come to us. Over several months we looked at numerous potential sites and due to one reason or another couldn't find an acceptable location. We ran into floor restrictions, ceiling height issues, limited parking, zoning issues and unaffordable rent. When we eventually met and talked with David Doolittle, Doolittle Investments LLC, he showed us two potential sites in Columbia. David seemed very interested in bringing our type of business into Columbia and offered us reasonable lease pricing and an honest willingness to work with us to bring our dream of a microbrewery to reality. The drive is 35 minutes from our homes, but after considering the location as fairly equally distant between Lancaster and York (both of which have more than one brewery), and the fact we would be first in Columbia and nearby Marietta and Wrightsville, plus the proximity to Route 30, we were sold on the location. We have since discovered that Columbia Borough is quite willing to help us establish our business in their wonderful town. We are thankful and grateful for their assistance and cooperation and look forward to being a part of the community.\r\n\r\nOur brewing equipment consists of a 5bbl brew kettle, a 5bbl mash tun, and a 5bbl hlt. We will have three 5bbl or larger fermenters. We are ale people so we will have blondes, pale ales, IPAs, Porters\/Stoudts, bitters, and a variety of Belgian versions as well. We will open with 4 taps and gradually expand to 8.\r\nWe expect to open this winter, Nov\/Dec., but that is dependent on receipt of the brewing equipment and completion of the site as tentatively scheduled. We will open quitely and plan for a more elaborate grand opening at a later date. This venture is a new experience for us and the people assisting us so we need to start out slowly. Our initial hours will be 5pm to 9pm Thursday and Friday and 12pm to 9pm on Saturday. We are planning a lite menu using seasonal local ingredients whenever possible.","website":"http:\/\/columbiakettleworks.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/e3IiS6\/upload_dQ4qDv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/e3IiS6\/upload_dQ4qDv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/e3IiS6\/upload_dQ4qDv-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-11 12:37:17","updateDate":"2014-02-11 12:37:54","id":"PDva3w","streetAddress":"40 North 3rd Street","locality":"Columbia","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17512","phone":"(717) 983-4242","website":"http:\/\/www.columbiakettleworks.com\/","latitude":40.032531,"longitude":-76.5036329,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-11 12:37:44","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"Ak1plQ","name":"Columbia River Brewing Co","website":"http:\/\/www.columbiariverbrewpub.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ak1plQ\/upload_BXzZFI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ak1plQ\/upload_BXzZFI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ak1plQ\/upload_BXzZFI-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2012-10-23 02:22:58","id":"oASJax","streetAddress":"1728 Northeast 40th Avenue","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97212","phone":"503-943-6157","website":"http:\/\/www.columbiariverbrewpub.com\/","latitude":45.5357374,"longitude":-122.6217912,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"evDRDG","name":"Columbia Valley Brewing","website":"http:\/\/columbiavalleybrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/evDRDG\/upload_5r2D8r-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/evDRDG\/upload_5r2D8r-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/evDRDG\/upload_5r2D8r-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-23 22:35:45","updateDate":"2012-07-24 00:44:25","id":"GERE6b","streetAddress":"538 Riverside Dr","locality":"Wenatchee","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98801","phone":"509-888-9993","website":"http:\/\/columbiavalleybrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:\t2:00 pm\t-\t10:00 pm\r\nWed:\t2:00 pm\t-\t10:00 pm\r\nThu:\t12:00 pm\t-\t12:00 am\r\nSat:\t12:00 pm\t-\t12:00 am\r\nSun:\t2:00 pm\t-\t10:00 pm","latitude":47.428002,"longitude":-120.331669,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-23 22:37:19","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"01Bp2T","name":"Columbus Brewing Company","description":"The Columbus Brewing Company was originally founded in 1830.

The idea spread as friends tasted the unique beers, and the popularity of those early batches encouraged a dedicated team of three partners to begin working to make the dream of a local brewery a reality. Mark Seibold, JD Merryweather and Daniel Mercer spent the next two years traveling throughout the United States, Europe and Central America visiting breweries and sampling local flavors. The insight gained from entrepreneurs, brewers, biologists, operations personnel and consumers provided an invaluable basis for a serious endeavor into quality commercial brewing. By integrating this knowledge with the local, regional and national brewing trends, as well as local feedback, the trio planned the birth and growth of the yet unnamed COOP. After nearly 3 years of research, comprising thousands of man hours and dozens of test batches, COOP fashioned its identity as a steadfast professional team that holds closely a passion for bringing quality, local beer to taps and homes in Oklahoma City and beyond.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith the help of close friends and fellow craft-beer fans, COOP was capitalized on July 15th, 2008. In less than 6 months, the COOP team; navigated the multi-layered regulatory process, secured a building lease, completed the remodel, purchased and installed a commercial brewery, obtained brewing licenses from the State of Oklahoma and the Federal Tax and Trade Bureau, created and branded original recipe beers and brewed the first full scale batches for distribution.\r\n\r\nThe outpouring of support that has come from friends of the COOP team has been overwhelming. Our sincere hope is that you \u2013 the fan of COOP Ale Works \u2013 will take pride in the beers, as if they were your own.

It started with the introduction of hop farming which flourished here until the end of the 19th century. Back then, Otsego and the surrounding counties produced most of the hops grown in the United States.\r\n\r\nTraveling through the upper Susquehanna Valley towards Cooperstown in July 1898, a visitor would have enjoyed the view of hop farms with those beautiful hop vines reaching toward the midsummer sky. Grandfather Eckler ws a hop farmer and he used to say, \"The hop was King in those days!\" His hop farm was in Westville, NY only three miles up the Cherry Valley from where our Brewery is now located. When it came time for the hops to be harvested, Grandma Eckler would \"put up\" a dozen people from \"the City' and they would pick the hops for their room and board and a \"vacation\" in the country. My mother, Cynthia Eckler Hall, said she always loved it when the hop pickers came to the farm. Everyone had a lot of fun during the harvest. When the blight devastated his crop in the early 1900's, grandfather turned to dairy farming.\r\nSettled by Englishmen in the early 1800's, Cooperstown once had two English-style breweries in town. Following that tradition, the Cooperstown Brewing Company was founded in 1994. We brew premium ales, porters, and stouts using the finest two-row English barley malts, West Coast hops and the English Ringwood Yeast.\r\n\r\nGrandpa would be pleased if he could see the Brewery. We have hops growing here that survived the devastating blight to New York hop farming and those hops grown here are used to finish our Back Yard India Pale Ale.","website":"http:\/\/www.cooperstownbrewing.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_liqoWx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_liqoWx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_liqoWx-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:05","id":"hG1G1v","streetAddress":"110 River Street","extendedAddress":"P.O.

During his college days the head brewer, Derek Luke, reaquired a homebrewing kit he had given his sister and quickly went to work brewing and passing his knowledge along to the company's president, Brent Ryan. As Graduation grew near and the cold reality of post-collegiate life set in Luke and Ryan knew that they could turn their affinity for beer and their new found ability to make it into a viable alternative to unemployment or sitting at a desk answering to \"The Man\". Of course, they couldn't do it by themselves, so after very little convincing, they got roommate and friends, Mark Sinclair and Will Rafferty to join them.\r\n\r\nOn Father's Day in 1999, after almost two years of planning and preperation, the first batch of Hurricane Amber Ale was brewed. By July 2nd the first kegs had been shipped to three Newport Restaurants and were quickly tapped and emptied. A little over a month after the release of the first kegs, 6-packs of Hurricane Amber Ale began to hit the shelves.

Being a farmer, he even started growing corn and other vegetables for them. One day, Larry's father showed up with a bushel of live crabs and left them with Dani to sell. The crabs sold so fast that they picked up more crabs, shrimp, and other types of seafood too. In 1994, Mr. Walters passed away and Dani and Larry had to move on to bigger and better things. They rented a space in the Chalfont Village Shopping Center and opened a restaurant and fresh fish market. Dani and Larry did all the cooking. Larry would go to the fish market daily to ensure the freshest seafood. And with the help of loyal family and friends, Jones Family Seafood became a popular seafood restaurant in the area.\r\n    Early in 2001, Larry received a mailing, the kind we all ignore, advertising \"Brew your own beer\". He was immediately hooked. After convincing Dani that this was a good idea, they met up with a \"brew master\", ordered the equipment, and they were on their way.","website":"http:\/\/www.crabbylarrys.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_OQ2A32-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_OQ2A32-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_OQ2A32-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:05","id":"WtMfgN","streetAddress":"237 West Butler Avenue","locality":"Chalfont","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18914","phone":"215-822-8788","website":"http:\/\/www.crabbylarrys.com\/","latitude":40.2795164,"longitude":-75.2142895,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1990","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"OQJeOY","name":"Crabtree Brewing Company","description":"The Crabtree Brewing Company is dedicated to serving the environment, the community, our customers, and our valued employees.

,{"id":"tE9Evu","name":"Crossroads Brewing Company","description":"If you could be doing whatever you want right now, what would you be doing? For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running \"off the grid\" as well.\r\n \r\nKen, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.

At a handful of downtown brewpubs the beer enthusiast can sample a variety of house made brews.

In this brewery all beers are handcrafted according to traditional brewing methods and are \"brewed with passion\"","website":"http:\/\/www.degarve.co.za\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:15","id":"l1YmMC","streetAddress":"Olga Kirsch St","locality":"Vanderbijlpark","postalCode":"1911","phone":"083 3040197","website":"http:\/\/www.degarve.co.za\/","latitude":-26.723674,"longitude":27.79237,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"ZA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"South Africa","isoThree":"ZAF","numberCode":710,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"qK2ec5","name":"De La Vega's Pecan Grill and Brewery","website":"http:\/\/www.pecangrill.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:16","id":"zf0Of4","streetAddress":"500 S Telshor Blvd","locality":"Las Cruces","region":"New Mexico","postalCode":"88011","phone":"575-521-1099","website":"http:\/\/www.pecangrill.com\/","latitude":32.309312,"longitude":-106.7435724,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"N6Udah","name":"De Leyerth Brouwerijen","website":"http:\/\/www.urthel.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-04-14 09:06:07","id":"byjCoV","streetAddress":"Krommekeerstraat 21","locality":"Ruiselede","region":"West-Vlaanderen","phone":"32-051-\/-68-89-99","latitude":51.0793011,"longitude":3.3695864,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"zQDRk8","name":"De Proef Brouwerij","website":"http:\/\/www.proefbrouwerij.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zQDRk8\/upload_Tk3CcK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zQDRk8\/upload_Tk3CcK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zQDRk8\/upload_Tk3CcK-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2013-10-30 11:29:32","id":"EIS0xw","streetAddress":"Doornzelestraat 20","locality":"Lochristi-Hijfte","region":"Oost-Vlaanderen","phone":"32-09-\/-356.71.02","latitude":51.1161477,"longitude":3.8163988,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"gq0pJS","name":"De Ridder Brewery","description":"Owned by Heineken","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-04 19:45:04","updateDate":"2013-05-10 12:54:24","id":"mEhLzL","streetAddress":"Oeverwal 3-9","region":"Maastricht","postalCode":"6221 EN","phone":"043-3216057","latitude":50.8501046,"longitude":5.6974806,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NL","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 12:55:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Netherlands","isoThree":"NLD","numberCode":528,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"HDGdZW","name":"De Steeg Brewing","description":"De Steeg Brewing -

In its brief commercial life to date, it has garnered respect and admiration from the beer enthusiast community and won several awards.\r\n\r\nOwners of a nearby ostrich-raising farm in Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern.\r\n\r\nUpon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational.\r\n\r\nThe company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning \"tough\". They render the name into English as \"The Sturdy Brewers\", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij 't IJ.\r\n\r\nFollowing current industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, DSB has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. While often drawing upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique products which reflect their own personal vision.\r\n\r\nThey have also collaborated with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers.","website":"http:\/\/struise.com\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_rK0nnu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_rK0nnu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_rK0nnu-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2013-10-30 11:30:48","id":"qcAp7N","streetAddress":"Woesten","locality":"Woesten","region":"West-Vlaanderen","website":"http:\/\/www.struisebrouwers.be\/","latitude":50.900311,"longitude":2.7831,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"QGZzrv","name":"De Vrolijke Brassers","description":"Artisanaal bier van hoge goesting met smaakevolutie, ambachtelijk gebrouwen.","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:14","id":"SvtdGo","streetAddress":"Baleunisstraat 56","locality":"Dendermonde","postalCode":"9200","latitude":51.0239756,"longitude":4.1126557,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","yearOpened":"2003","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"TWODoR","name":"Dead Armadillo Brewery","description":"At Dead Armadillo Craft Brewing we are committed to crafting fine beers that meet the highest standards of the industry.

Drawing inspiration from beer gardens of Bavaria, we designed Denver Beer Co. to be a place where new and old friends can share a table and pint out of doors.","website":"http:\/\/denverbeerco.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vuehNG\/upload_v8tjkq-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vuehNG\/upload_v8tjkq-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vuehNG\/upload_v8tjkq-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2013-01-27 17:32:00","id":"anUUVa","streetAddress":"1695 Platte St","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80202","phone":"720-295-4781","website":"http:\/\/denverbeerco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 3:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 12:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 9:00 pm","latitude":39.7581967,"longitude":-105.0073142,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"yOkqyc","name":"Denver Pearl Brewing Company","description":"Located in the Platt Park neighborhood near the University of Denver, Denver Pearl plans to offer five flagship and five seasonal beers.  \"We want to take old styles and put creative new twists on them.\"","website":"http:\/\/www.denverpearlbrewing.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yOkqyc\/upload_YNUCii-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yOkqyc\/upload_YNUCii-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yOkqyc\/upload_YNUCii-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-20 15:32:24","updateDate":"2014-04-20 16:49:07","id":"IQszxN","streetAddress":"1875 South Pearl Street","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80210","phone":"(303) 968-6674","website":"http:\/\/www.denverpearlbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\nWed:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  3:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\n\n","latitude":39.6825659,"longitude":-104.9807821,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-20 15:35:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:28:04","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"YENVWh","name":"Depot Deli and Lounge","description":"Inspired by the everyday family cooking that we grew up with, you\u2019ll feel at home while savoring a great meal in our casual and relaxed dining room in a restored Railroad Depot.

When he wasn\u2019t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick\u2019s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick\u2019s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick\u2019s Brewing Company became a reality.\r\n\r\nDick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, \u201cI started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty\u201d.   And we are all so grateful he was.\r\n\r\nThe brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick\u2019s Beers were flying out the door.\r\nIn 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.\r\n\r\nDick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.\r\n\r\nToday, the Dick\u2019s Brew Crew is led by Dick\u2019s daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick\u2019s legacy.  All of us here at Dick\u2019s are proud to continue the dream that our founder started, and we are proud to have you all along for the ride.","website":"http:\/\/dicksbeer.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_vNkqm1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_vNkqm1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_vNkqm1-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-01-28 20:24:58","id":"TkT8Rc","streetAddress":"5945 Prather Road","locality":"Centralia","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98531","phone":"800-586-7760","website":"http:\/\/dicksbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Fridays 3pm - 7pm","latitude":46.771347,"longitude":-123.007543,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"YG37Js","name":"Dickersbach Brewing Company","description":"A long long time ago, in a far away place called North Carolina it all started.

They first met during graduate school at the University of Minnesota where the fates would have it, they joined the same chemistry research group.  The guys spent many a night proving the adage of their PhD (piled higher & deeper) advisor, \u201cThe true test of running a scientific instrument is being able to operate it after a few beers.\u201d  After graduation, Grant and Phil pursued different career paths, Grant went the academic route, while Phil initially started out in the chemical industry, but then wised up and conned people into hiring him as a beer then wine chemist.  After a few years of chasing the academic and corporate dollar, the boys wised up and decided to strike out on their own.  They landed in Vancouver, WA (which was the first Vancouver, by the way) and started up Dirty Hands Brewing Company.  From the start, their goal was to brew full flavored beers that were both balanced and highly drinkable.  So, they set to work, getting their hands dirty renovating the space that was the old Columbian Newspaper building to a working brewery and taproom.  Speaking of the newspaper, that\u2019s how the name came about.  Think of reading a hard copy paper and how your hands would look from getting newsprint all over them!  The brewery also strives to honor the working past of Vancouver and Washington state by using locally sourced ingredients in the beer and food that we serve.","website":"http:\/\/dirtyhandsbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ywrnRJ\/upload_kHJSLD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ywrnRJ\/upload_kHJSLD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ywrnRJ\/upload_kHJSLD-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-23 02:20:26","updateDate":"2014-09-23 15:55:41","id":"UfTXZT","streetAddress":"114 E.

Nick graduated from the University of Missouri-Columbia with a degree in Chemical Engineering. After graduation, Nick got a call from the Harpoon Brewery in Boston and they were willing to give him a shot. While he was working out east, he enjoyed the superb beer culture and variety of beers available in New England. But he knew that he would one day return to Missouri. Finally, after three years, probably too many beers, and the addition of his son, Nick finally got his chance to come back to Missouri. He worked at a small brewpub in Kansas City called The 75th Street Brewery where he was able to experiment with many different beer styles and brewing techniques. Again after a few years, Nick grew restless. While working at a brewpub was fun and enjoyable, it just had too many other distractions from his true passions... Brewing beer, drinking beer and spreading the word about craft beer.\r\nSo he started the Doodle Brewing Company with every intention of brewing beers and beer styles that explore the boundries of flavor. He's probably sitting in front of his brewhouse right now with a beer enjoying what he's doing because he's making beer for you.","website":"http:\/\/www.doodlebrewing.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ifZ8V4\/upload_S4bCUw-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ifZ8V4\/upload_S4bCUw-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ifZ8V4\/upload_S4bCUw-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:14","id":"bTThBS","streetAddress":"600 Haines Drive","locality":"Liberty","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"64068","website":"http:\/\/www.doodlebrewing.com\/","latitude":39.254543,"longitude":-94.455085,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"MpYI7s","name":"Doolally","description":"Doolally is arguably the best among the handfull of Micro-breweries in India.

They have also continued to win medals at both the World Beer Cup and the Great American Beer Festival, including Small Brewing Company of the Year in 2009.","website":"http:\/\/www.drydockbrewing.com\/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_pXDs0P-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_pXDs0P-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_pXDs0P-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2013-10-04 16:52:18","id":"LWD44j","streetAddress":"15120 E.

Dahls Brewery was founded in 1856 by Erich Christian Dahl (1814\u20131882), a local businessman and consul-general from Trondheim. He was the son of Erich Dahl (1774-1821) Christine Lyche (1776-1861). His parents had been the owners of an import-export business and shipping company. In 1851, Erich Christian Dahl had bought the Sugarhouse (Sukkerhuset) in the Kalvskinnet area of Trondheim, where there had been a sugar refinery since 1754. Sukkerhuset was rebuilt for brewing. The brewery stayed in the building until 1984.\r\n\r\nThe first bottle of Bayer\u00f8l, a Munich-style dunkel, was sold in 1857. In 1910, the plant began to produce soft drinks at the brewery as well. Bayer\u00f8l was the most important type of beer until the early 20th century when Dahls Pils, a pilsener took over as the most popular beer.\r\n\r\nIn 1966, it was merged with Trondheim Akti Brewery (Trondhjems Aktiebryggeri), which was founded in 1899 and Trondheim Brewery (Trondhjems Bryggeri) which dated to 1919.

Both had an entrepanerial passion, but never thought of a microbrewery as their business.  \"The decision was made for us.  Make a business out of something you love to do and you will never work another day in your life\" the couple states.  A lot of hard work and a love for good beer motivates the business. \r\nWe decided to open Eastern Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael's Winery, and were told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers took home medals in the Maryland Govenor's cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael's Amber ALe) on October 9th.  And although happy with the medals, Eastern Shore Brewing's goals are to continue to grow the busines and improve their products.

After much planning, research and construction business was begun in March of 1994. The brewery is a small 17-barrel (527 gallon) batch system and operates on the Acevedo's rural residential property.  Within seven months of opening El Toro Brewing Company received its first national recognition at the 1994 Great American Beer Festival (GABF). One of its flagships El Toro Oro Golden Ale won a coveted Gold Medal for English Pale Ale. At the 1996 GABF Poppy Jasper Amber Ale, the brewery's other flagship beer, won a Silver Medal for English Brown Ale. It is a mild yet robust brown ale. The 1997 GABF saw El Toro garner another Gold Medal for the American styled wheat beer named after the brewer's father-in-law, William Jones Wheat Beer.  After 16 years of planning, Geno and Cindy Acevedo of Morgan Hill finally opened a brewpub on November 25 2006. El Toro Brewpub is a two floored building with patio. Inside is the world's only Poppy Jasper Bar. Featuring over 45 feet of gorgeously inlaid and polished Poppy Jasper rock into its surface. To the back of the large mirrored bar you will find over 25 beers and handcrafted sodas on tap. We also have a gleaming copper Pub Brewing system 3 BBL (100 gallon) brewery. Live music and dancing will also be a regular nighttime happening at the brewpub consisting of mostly local bands playing cover type and original Rock, Blues, Jazz and Reggae.","website":"http:\/\/www.eltorobrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yuxw75\/upload_FDaJZb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yuxw75\/upload_FDaJZb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yuxw75\/upload_FDaJZb-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2013-08-08 12:23:49","id":"4F7QA9","streetAddress":"17605 Monterey Road","locality":"Morgan Hill","region":"California","postalCode":"95037","phone":"408-782-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.eltorobrewing.com\/","latitude":37.1304557,"longitude":-121.6546846,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"KPVOOd","name":"Eldo Brewery and Taproom","website":"http:\/\/www.eldobrewpub.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:16","id":"gYqEJa","streetAddress":"215 Elk Ave Crested","extendedAddress":"PO Box 21","locality":"Butte","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"81224","phone":"970-349-6125","website":"http:\/\/www.eldobrewpub.com\/","latitude":38.8697835,"longitude":-106.9872811,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"bEgkGW","name":"Eldridge, Pope and Co.","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:06","id":"IsZ2T1","locality":"Dorchester","region":"Dorset","latitude":50.711905,"longitude":-2.441554,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"wjECY4","name":"Electric Brewing Co","description":"Arizona's first microbrewery.. 30 bbl home built gravity system, located on the edge of scenic Bisbee.

The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling. The luxurious back-bar won the coveted blue ribbon for craftsmanship at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

Way back in 1988, Luch Scremin was a Freshman in college and became interested in brewing his own beer.  Since the internet did not exist, Luch was forced to order a \u201cbeer kit\u201d from an ad in the back of an issue of Popular Mechanics.  Suffice it to say that what resulted was indeed beer but was far from great.\r\n\r\nFast forward twenty years and the love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew.  Luch traveled the world with his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles and beer culture.  In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub,  Luch met his future business partners Andy and Sean.  The three were soon making the business a reality.\r\n\r\nAll that was left was a name.  They soon decided they would name the brewery for Luch\u2019s 1962 Ford Fire Engine \u2013 after all, they just don\u2019t make them like that anymore.  It represents all that Engine 15 Brewing Co. is about. Camaraderie, old school know how, determination and a simple but serious dedication to the cause.\r\nAs of 2011, Engine 15 Brewing Co. has enjoyed success and was even voted best Pub and Brewpub  in Jacksonville by the Folio Weekly readers poll.

The equinox, and the intrigue of equal night and day, has deep roots in history and ritual. But, at the same time, the equinox marks the changing of the season, and forces us to look toward the future. We find it interesting that the two days out of the year that have perfect light and dark balance also show the balance between the past and the future, tradition and innovation. Beer contains similar elements. Sure, there\u2019s the balance of flavors in a beer; sweet and bitter, rich and simple\u2026\r\n\r\nWe find another aspect of beer\u2019s balancing act fascinating. Historically, beer styles have developed because of limitations in local ingredients and the necessity to make do with what you have. However, due to global trade and modern shipping methods, limitations on ingredients have been removed. We can get any ingredients we want. While most modern brewers recognize the importance of beer styles and learn from the brewers who made them, they certainly don\u2019t limit themselves to making beers that fit into traditional definitions.\r\n\r\nOn one level our beers fit into some traditional styles, but we put our own twist on them. We want our beers to capture elements from the past and incorporate new ideas, ingredients and techniques into them. We\u2019re not afraid to try new things.\r\n\r\nAs a brewer, its playtime and work, balanced.","website":"http:\/\/www.equinoxbrewing.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_b1atTK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_b1atTK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_b1atTK-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:12","id":"YKa9wh","streetAddress":"133 Remington Street","locality":"Fort Collins","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80524","phone":"970-430-6489","website":"http:\/\/www.equinoxbrewing.com\/","latitude":40.586331,"longitude":-105.0757067,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"LHQ79n","name":"Erie Brewing Company","description":"Erie Brewing Co. is a microbrewery that offers award winning craft beers to the Erie community and along the East Coast.

Esser started producing lager in a small brewery he bought in Monroe for $1,500. In 1863, he purchased 2 1\/2 acres of land in Cross Plains. The original building had two cellars below and several rooms above to house Esser's family. The beer, known as Esser's Best, was first brewed in October, 1863. He was joined in this enterprise in 1881 by his son Jacob. At that time, the brewery had a capacity of 2,000 barrels. A barrel of beer cost $7, and a case containing 36 pint bottles was priced at $1.75. Jacob and his sons, primarily Werner (W.B.) and Peter (Spundt) began delivering beer to the surrounding communities, often starting out as early as 3 a.m. Werner acted as Brew master from 1907 to 1910. It was increased competition from the larger breweries that forced him to become a distributor. The first beer that he handled as a distributor was Hausmann's originally brewed in Madison in 1920, Werner became the distributor for Blatz Near Beer. Following Prohibition in 1933, the company again to distribute beer. It should be noted that during prohibition, Werner and his brothers were kept very busy taking care of the beer needs in the area, mostly doing business at night. In 1937, Werner's eldest son, Roman, became a partner. At this point, the company began to handle Old Style products out of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The family tradition continued when Del Esser, Werner's youngest son, joined the firm in 1948. In 1988, Roman's son, Wayne, took over the business. In 1990, Wayne was joined in the business by his son, Larry, which made six generations of Essers in the bee business.

For the first summer the Event Center kept the main floor as a stage and dance floor. For the first summer we offered four beers:  Estes Park Porter, Estes Park Renegade, Longs Peak Raspberry Wheat and Estes Park Pale Ale.  In the fall of 1994, Gordon Knight decided to sell his half of the business. When Gordon left, Eric Bratrud took over as the head Brewer. The Brewery also expanded to a 14 BBL Brewhouse and moved out onto the main floor where is now located. In 1995 we started packaging our beers in 12 oz bottles, which expanded our market. By this time we had added a number of beers including Trail Ridge Red, Estes Park Gold, Stinger Wild Honey Wheat and Samson Stout. 1995 was also the first year of the Best of the West Brewfest held in the Brewery parking lot. Since '95 we've continued to evolve both in our restaurant and with our brewing operations.

We pride ourselves on making great beer, with all the flavor one could want, that people will actually want to drink whenever and with whatever. Again, great doesn\u2019t have to be complicated.\r\n\r\nAnother of our fundamental ideas is that brewing is free, and should be open.

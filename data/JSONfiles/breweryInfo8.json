We support anything from school groups to ski clubs to horse rescue to the mentors program because, well, they support us and honestly it\u2019s the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nDough. We like dough. It fits well in wallets and tastes good under cheese. We like to think we\u2019ve got some good dough. We make pizza crust, we make sandwich bread, and we make finely crafted dog sweaters. Alright, we don\u2019t make the last one, but we COULD if we wanted to. We take pride in the freshness of our dough and veggies. Our dough was made today. It wasn\u2019t made in Topeka, frozen, shipped here, and warmed up. Ask who made it and he or she is probably in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nWhy no Straws? We know you didn\u2019t get one. You\u2019ll use them for about seven minutes and then we have to throw them away. It\u2019s nothing personal. If you absolutely need one we\u2019re happy to oblige, but we\u2019re trying to reduce our non-recyclables, keep our landfills at a minimum, and keep plastic out of our oceans. Find a kid and ask them about plastic. Plastic pollutes our oceans and air, so we serve our beverages in glass. If you want to bring a kid cup from home, we\u2019ll fill it up!\r\n\r\nWhat, no Coasters? You\u2019d be amazed at how many coasters we pick up off the floor. If our tables were Peruvian mahogany, inlaid with reclaimed oak from an historic church in New Brunswick, we\u2019d say \u201check yeah, give that pizza patron a coaster!\u201d Let\u2019s conserve together.\r\n\r\nHopefully you\u2019re now thinking, \u201cWow Henrietta, these are some globally concerned restaurateurs.\u201d But, then again, maybe you\u2019re wondering about the lack of ice in the sodas? Are we trying to conserve ice bergs? Nope. We don\u2019t even know any icebergs. Our soda\u2019s are handmade with the finest extracts available, fantastic water and cane sugar. They\u2019re served at cellar temps just like our beers, so you get a full flavored beverage that doesn\u2019t need to be watered down. There\u2019s a saying in Colorado, Whiskey\u2019s for drinking, water\u2019s for fighting. (We also have Whiskey, no fighting). If you want ice, just ask. We\u2019ll not think less of you. Becoming a soda pop connoisseur takes time.\r\n\r\nFrom all of us at Moonlight Pizza: Kick back, order another beer, enjoy the sunset, and don\u2019t forget your leftovers!

Curiosity eventually got the best of us, and we combined the two - our first batch of homebrew was conceived in the early 90's with home brewing equipment, books, and some ingredients handed down from our parent's home brewing days in the 70's.\r\n\r\nSince then we've learned a lot about brewing professionally.

And, as always, serve fantastic beer and food.","website":"http:\/\/www.mudgeebrewing.com.au\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xm6rt6\/upload_FSXp6c-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xm6rt6\/upload_FSXp6c-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xm6rt6\/upload_FSXp6c-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-03 21:58:38","updateDate":"2014-03-03 23:16:47","id":"dM7gjl","streetAddress":"4 Church Street","locality":"Mudgee","region":"New South Wales","postalCode":"2850","phone":"+61 2 6372 6726","website":"http:\/\/www.mudgeebrewing.com.au\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Tue: 8:00 am - 5:30 pm\r\nWed - Sun: 8:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":-32.5902793,"longitude":149.588563,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AU","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-03 23:15:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"BzJnwS","name":"Mudhook Brewing Co","website":"http:\/\/mudhookbrewingco.com","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:17","id":"Owkz44","streetAddress":"34 N Cherry Ln","locality":"York","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17401","phone":"717-542-4015","website":"http:\/\/mudhookbrewingco.com","latitude":39.9625084,"longitude":-76.7289161,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"WO7A3K","name":"Mudshark Brewing Company","website":"http:\/\/www.mudsharkbeer.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WO7A3K\/upload_XxZmvK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WO7A3K\/upload_XxZmvK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WO7A3K\/upload_XxZmvK-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2013-08-06 22:34:31","id":"1GTnDV","streetAddress":"210 Swanson Avenue","locality":"Lake Havasu City","region":"Arizona","postalCode":"86403","phone":"(928) 453-2981","website":"http:\/\/mudsharkbeer.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 11:00 am - 10:30 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 11:30 pm\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 10:30 pm","latitude":34.46855,"longitude":-114.341145,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"wd1Y84","name":"M\u00fchlengrund Braugasthaus","established":"1586","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:18:29","updateDate":"2012-08-13 14:01:12","id":"oCpxft","streetAddress":"M\u00fchlenstra\u00dfe 1","locality":"Wienhausen","region":"Niedersachsen","postalCode":"D-29342","latitude":52.579915,"longitude":10.187675,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:48:00","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"XWih3e","name":"Mully's Brewery","description":"Southern Maryland's first Production Craft Brewery!

So, it\u2019s a tribute, it\u2019s recognition that there is just as much art to brewing as there is science, and it\u2019s a gentle reminder that to move forward and create a truly excellent future, sometimes you have to look at the past.","website":"http:\/\/www.mysterybrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/goT5b","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_vN4pal-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_vN4pal-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_vN4pal-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2013-08-09 12:53:53","id":"xoGGQz","streetAddress":"437 Dimmocks Mill Road","extendedAddress":"Suite 41","locality":"Hillsborough","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27278","phone":"919-697-8379","website":"http:\/\/www.mysterybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tap Room:  Friday 6pm - 11pm\r\nOtherwise, By Appointment Only","latitude":36.070686,"longitude":-79.114137,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"KD65Yd","name":"Public House","streetAddress":"230 South Nash Street","locality":"Hillsborough","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27278","phone":"(919) 245-1325","website":"http:\/\/www.mysterybrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"M 4 - 10PM\r\nT - Th 4PM - 12AM\r\nF 2PM - 12AM\r\nSat 12PM - 12AM\r\nSun 12PM - 10PM","latitude":36.0736632,"longitude":-79.1110699,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-09 12:44:26","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"7yzKhF","name":"Mystic Brewery","description":"Mystic microbes abhorred the isolation of the industrial age.

The secondary focus is to experiment with different styles of beer and explore the art of brewing. Ideally, I would like to brew 3 times a week.

One was an engineer toiling away on the super computers of a local university, and the other was a supervisor managing the complex operations of a local billionaire. Both of them loved their jobs, but more than their jobs they loved beer. Each Don had a recurring dream of a magical place without a name, a place where the great beers of the world flowed like the Salmon le Sac at flood stage, and the fine brewing tradition of the Pacific Northwest stood proudly beside the best concoctions from far-flung breweries in Asia and across Europe.\r\n\r\nDon and Donald worked tirelessly in the wee hours on their home brew mixtures, searching for the best possible combination of hops, malt, barley, and love. For long years, the two Dons had their separate dreams, and never met. A local poet named Bryan had the pleasure of growing up with Donald, and worked for the same local billionaire as Don. After many months of hearing Don speak of his dream of the magical beer haven, Bryan knew it must be the very same place of which Donald had spoken too. He knew instinctively that it was his responsibility to bring the two Dons together. On a fateful summer afternoon at the Elysian Brewery on Capitol Hill, the two Dons met. The event later became known as THE HAPPY HOUR OF DESTINY.\r\n\r\nEvery patron in the pub knew something special was happening that day. The magical place both men dreamed of was one and the same. That very afternoon, the two Dons vowed to create a great beer haven right here on earth, and together they would name this magic place THE NAKED CITY. In THE NAKED CITY, it doesn't matter where you're going or where you've been, all that matters is great living and great beer. In THE NAKED CITY, the only problem is what great craft beer to try next. The two Dons spent a combined 25 years studying the world's great brewing traditions, and couldn't wait to begin experimenting together. Their very first batch of beer, an Oak-aged double IPA, took a ribbon in the Northwest regionals of the 2007 National Homebrew Competition. The rest, as they say, is history.\r\n\r\nTwo years after the two Dons combined their separate dreams, THE NAKED CITY opened its doors. Now Naked City boasts an award-winning brewery that produces a variety of small-batch beers available at the pub and friendly bars and restaurants in Seattle, Tacoma, Bellingham, and beyond. The 24 taps of THE NAKED CITY offer a constantly rotating variety of Washington's best beers, regional craft beers, and the best beers Donald and Don have found in two lifetimes of beer travels around the world.\r\n\r\nTwo and a half years after THE NAKED CITY was founded, the Dons convinced the local poet who brought them together to join them in the adventure. The Dons and Bryan together built a bigger brewery; a full-size kitchen; a dining room\/movie theatre called The Screening Room that features free monthly events including film, comedy, poetry, community discusssion, and jazz; and now The Walrus Beer Garden, a patio that's home to murals by local artists, games, and summertime events.\r\n\r\nSo. Welcome to THE NAKED CITY, where great beer lovers flock like the salmon of Capistrano, and the only question is: WHAT TAP NEXT?","website":"http:\/\/www.nakedcitybrewing.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WF34ng\/upload_s2ninP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WF34ng\/upload_s2ninP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WF34ng\/upload_s2ninP-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-09-18 11:14:39","id":"R59V2j","streetAddress":"8564 Greenwood Ave N","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98103","phone":"206-838-6299","website":"http:\/\/www.nakedcitybrewing.com\/","latitude":47.691833,"longitude":-122.35509,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"YglaK6","name":"Naked Dove Brewing Company","description":"Naked Dove Brewing company was born through our passionate commitment to the art and science of brewing.\r\n\r\nAt Naked Dove we concentrate on doing one thing: utilizing the best ingredients that the world has to offer to brew world class beers locally.

In 2006 we decided to let the brewery evolve to an even more natural state, and by October of that year we were granted Certified Organic status. In a sense, we were getting back to our roots. People have been brewing organically for over 6000 years; the current practice of large-scale industrial farming with synthetic fertilizers and pesticides is an aberration of traditional farming, and therefore brewing, practices. Choosing organic production is also in keeping with the spirit of our home town of Nelson, a laid-back, progressive community nestled in the heart of the Kootenays. With limitless backcountry skiing and hiking at our back door, as well as a host of other outdoor activities year-round, brewing an organic beer in Nelson just seems like the natural thing to do.\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to be organic? Organic certification is a guarantee that our beer and its ingredients were produced without the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or genetic engineering. Our processes, cleaning and sanitation regimes must also adhere to a strict set of organic principles and be approved by our organic certification body. Being organic also signifies a commitment to environmental sustainability. Our goal is to eventually source all of our ingredients as locally as possible. Most of our barley is already malted right here in BC, and we are working with local farmers toward the planting of certified organic hops. Our spent materials are recycled by local farmers as feed and compost.","website":"http:\/\/nelsonbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2013-06-21 12:08:37","id":"YoA3mZ","streetAddress":"512 Latimer Street","locality":"Nelson","region":"British Columbia","phone":"1-250-352-3582","latitude":49.4883757,"longitude":-117.2900382,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"0o5iQ6","name":"Neptunes Brewery","description":"A small brewery and tap room in Livingston, Montana that focuses on great beer, food and service.

That's when the first batches of home-brewed beer began appearing and David's wife Lori began to realize that her husband was forming a lifetime passion.  David's passion would continue to grow and evolve.  He learned the tradition of brewing in America.  The history of small family owned breweries that we able to serve fresh handcrafted beer to their local communities.  The fact that the these small local breweries became points of pride in the community and that the businesses would stay in the family for generations.  \r\n \r\nAn idea began to grow.  The idea that despite the brewing world we live in now with mega breweries pumping out mass marketed bland beer, that a small locally owned brewery making fresh unique beer could again be a source of pride for a community.  David dreamed of recreating this American brewing tradition and so set out on his way to do just that.\r\n \r\nDavid spent the next 7 years honing his craft.

But his obvious passion for the brewing craft led him to the title assistant brewer and eventually head brewer in short three years. At that time he joined forces with former NHB colleague Blair Potts to run Quality Assured Brewing, a consulting service for microbreweries throughout the North East. 1996 saw Rob as the Brew Master for both the Manchester and Westport, CT locations in The John Harvard\u2019s Brew House chain. While there, Rob won a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival in the German Altbier category. Southern Connecticut, especially Norwalk, took a liking to Rob and that was where he became the brewmaster and operations manager for New England Brewing. He learned the sales end of beer and when the owners wanted to get out of the brewery business, Rob immediately took the opportunity to acquire the name of the company and re-locate the whole business just down the street from the kitchen where he first started making beer.","website":"http:\/\/newenglandbrewing.com\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_nljup8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_nljup8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_nljup8-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:11","id":"jzO9Iv","streetAddress":"7 Selden St","locality":"Woodbridge","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06525","phone":"203-387-2222","website":"http:\/\/newenglandbrewing.com\/","latitude":41.3389393,"longitude":-72.9816961,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"mAe67E","name":"New English Brewing","description":"New English Brewing Company - Traditional New English Style, Authentic West Coast Character","website":"http:\/\/www.newenglishbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mAe67E\/upload_4ZIsHz-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mAe67E\/upload_4ZIsHz-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mAe67E\/upload_4ZIsHz-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-03-16 21:42:39","id":"MJ6xSM","streetAddress":"11545 Sorrento Valley Rd,","extendedAddress":"Ste 305","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92121","phone":"(619) 857-8023","website":"http:\/\/www.newenglishbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed - Fri: 4:00 pm - 7:00 pm\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 6:00 pm","latitude":32.912605,"longitude":-117.230486,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"YWVg1z","name":"New Glarus Brewing Company","description":"Welcome to our quaint little brewery nestled on the outskirts of New Glarus, Wisconsin.

Nikos was sampling a beer Jamie had brewed at a local\r\nrestaurant\/brewery and through mutual friends, the two started talking.\r\nThe conversation landed on the question, \u201cWhat would you do if you could\r\nopen your own brewery?\u201d With Nikos\u2019 background in finance and Jamie\u2019s\r\nexperience in brewing, it seemed like a good skillset for starting a brewery.\r\nThe two began brewing about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when\r\nNikos and Jamie spent 17 hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination\r\nIPA. The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German\r\nrestaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped\r\nwith a 15-barrel brew house. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one\r\nsoul driving purpose\u2014through the creation of the highest quality beers;\r\nto improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its\r\nemployees, and business partners.\r\n\r\nBoth founders knew they wanted to do things differently\u2014within the beer\r\nindustry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape\r\nwas home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company\r\nthat represented what beer meant to them\u2014a source of community and\r\nthe root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi\u2014the Sumerian goddess of\r\nfermentation\u2014was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer\r\nnot only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but\r\nwas also the center of community and culture, one never in operation\r\nwithout the other\u2014a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to\r\nfind property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real\r\nestate in Eugene\u2019s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its\r\ncurrent location in 2007.\r\nSince then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to produce more\r\nbeer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility,\r\ntasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the\r\nfocus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi\u2019s culture continues to embody\r\n\u201cBelieve in the Goddess\u201d\u2014symbolizing the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated\r\nhuman experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer.\r\nThe current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system, with a capacity of\r\n95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska,\r\nCalifornia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.\r\nThe Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series, has grown from\r\nits first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA,\r\nBeliever Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout,\r\nand Quantum Pale Ale. Today, the Ninkasi family of brands includes its\r\nFlagship, Seasonal Release, Special Release, Prismatic Lager, Single Hop,\r\nand R&D Series.","website":"http:\/\/www.ninkasibrewing.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/V4I9FT\/upload_V8Ophh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/V4I9FT\/upload_V8Ophh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/V4I9FT\/upload_V8Ophh-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2013-11-01 11:44:26","id":"KzHweV","streetAddress":"272 Van Buren St","locality":"Eugene","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97402","phone":"877-7-NINKASI","website":"http:\/\/www.ninkasibrewing.com\/","latitude":44.056855,"longitude":-123.10988,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"4GJFCc","name":"No Label Brewing Company","description":"Our mission is to create exceptional hand-crafted Ales and Lagers that are unique to Katy and Texas.\r\n\r\nWe are a family owned and operated brewery in Katy, TX.

Kurt had a day job in the insurance business but started to dream of someday opening his own commercial brewery. After years of resisting the temptation, he finally succumbed (with support from his wife, Lori) by buying a building in 2009. Previously owned brewing equipment was acquired in July 2009 in Anaconda, Montana and moved to the Mount Vernon location. Building permits were finally obtained and brewery construction began in October 2009. Federal and state brewery licenses applications were submitted March 1, 2010 and approved by July 2010.  Brewing operations commenced later that month and on August 27, 2010 the first kegs of North Sound Brewing Co. ales were sold to local pubs in Mount Vernon, WA.

Instead of having a few flagship beers available at all times, we release two new beers each month. These are only around while they last and then will be supplanted by the next styles in line. You can think about it as brewing only *seasonals* such as a stout or a winter warmer in the winter, a nice malty brown in the fall, or a refreshing kolsch or hefeweizen in the summer.

Company, 1812 Post Road, Plover, is ready to offer local residents a taste of the unusual as they begin to brew their first batch of beer.\r\n\r\nThe company, founded by Marc Buttera and Bart Peterson, has one goal: brew beer differently. \"I don't think anyone around here offers what I'm looking at ... we want to fill some voids,I don't want to make a regular brown ale, or pale ale. I want to do something that fits in between.\"\r\n\r\nThe dream for Buttera started when he was in college, and a friend turned him on to home brewing, which he has been doing now for about 13 years. Four years ago, his love of home brewing led him to open the Point Brew Supply, 1816 Post Road, Plover, with his wife, Katina.\r\n\r\n\"It (Point Brew Supply) has opened my eyes to all the different ingredients that I think a lot of brewers don't have exposure to,\" \"I've played with every single strain of yeast and grain and hop in there.\r\n\r\nO'so Brewing Co. is planning to have a varied lineup of beers, with interesting names and flavors.

The start-up of production was dedicated to the 1980 Olympic Games.\r\n\r\nCzech experts were engaged in the project as world-renowned brewmasters. They were the ones who identified the construction site for the new brewery. The choice of construction site was determined by the main factor, namely the availability of huge reserves of soft, crystal-clear water. Today, the water from Jurassic bedrock (290 m) ensures the high quality of our products.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, the enterprise gave the impetus to developing the largest corporation in Ukraine to produce beer, low alcohol and soft drinks, and mineral water.\r\n\r\nThe plant received its current name only in 1986, after the district of Kyiv with the same name. The word \u2018Obolon\u2019 comes from the times of Kievan Rus, when it denoted low riverside meadows.\r\n\r\nBuilt according to a Czech design, the brewery produced beer that gained wide popularity. After Ukraine became independent, Obolon was the first corporation to export hopped beverages to Europe and the USA. Obolon trademark beer started being perceived as traditional Ukrainian beer in the whole world.\r\n\r\nAfter a quarter of a century, Obolon has evolved into a world-renowned trademark.

After some early batches with extracts, it took less than a year to trade up to all-grain brewing in a friend's basement apartment. The youngest of six in a family of caterers, he may have it in his genes to provide others with food and drink, and the early experiments proved a hit at weekly parties on Missoula's University Avenue. Dan tried his hand at the homebrew standards--stouts, porters, English-style ales, etc.--but also made a mean hefeweizen (no lemon, please), alt, marzen, dunkel, and other Continental styles. Since moving to Portland in 2001, he's quenched the thirst of friends, neighbors and guests--not just college partygoers but beer geeks who live in Beervana for a reason. After a slight detour for law school and the cat-herding world of criminal defense, Dan swapped his back-porch setup for a bigger set of kettles and fermenters.","website":"http:\/\/occidentalbrewing.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:19","id":"5qaoia","streetAddress":"6635 N.

This journey has opened our eyes (and taste buds) to some of the finest examples of beer this planet has to offer. Our tastes and expectations have forever changed, and so have our methods of enjoyment. From beer trades, to home brewing, to attending release parties and festivals one thing became clear\u2026 We rarely drink the same beer over and over again, and we love to share.\r\n\r\nOur IPAs will be constantly revolving depending on inspiration, hop variety, availability, and season. We will make everything from low gravity Sessions, to Regulars, Doubles, Triples and even a San Diego Pale Ale or two. We will make sure these styles are released, distributed, and tapped\u2026 FRESH!\r\n\r\nWe like big beers and we cannot lie! From the biggest Russian Imperial Stouts aged in spirit barrels to malty Double Reds, Smooth Porters, and velvety Wee Heavies, we just can\u2019t get enough of these complex beauties. Thick mouthfeel, high gravity, and rich flavors suitable for aging to be shared with family and friends. Crack one open to celebrate a special occasion, or just because its a Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMouth puckering sour ales is another style which we adore. One which we hoard, savor, and curse for not being more readily available. Using wine barrels from local Virginia Wineries we will age some carefully crafted super tart ales, blending them when needed and using fruits for character. Once the bugs catch up to our pipeline, expect a new sour to be released every month.\r\n\r\nAt Ocelot, we love two things\u2026 Beer and Music!\r\n\r\nWe believe in inspiration. It can come in many forms and varies from person to person. For us, music has always been our inspiration. Music has been the soundtrack to our lives and has in one way or another crafted every decision we\u2019ve made. We aim to create and dedicate our beers to the music that has inspired our journey through life.\r\n\r\nOcelot Brewing Company is a reflection of us, our styles, and our habits. From chasing freshies to cellaring whales and everything in between. We will craft many different beers in small batches. We brew beer we want to drink when we want to drink it. Come by and visit, listen to some tunes, grab a pint, fill a growler, and join us on this adventure.","website":"http:\/\/ocelotbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_umGWaC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_umGWaC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_umGWaC-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-12 17:31:01","updateDate":"2013-12-12 17:31:45","id":"oPxIne","streetAddress":"23600 Overland Drive","extendedAddress":"#180","locality":"Sterling","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20166","phone":"(703) 474-3050","website":"http:\/\/ocelotbrewing.com\/","latitude":38.960326,"longitude":-77.5030993,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-12 17:31:34","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"hLk7hD","name":"Ochakovo","website":"http:\/\/www.ochakovo.ru\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hLk7hD\/upload_8AbdfV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hLk7hD\/upload_8AbdfV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hLk7hD\/upload_8AbdfV-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2012-03-27 01:03:51","id":"Z7U3KK","streetAddress":"44, Riabinivaya","locality":"Moscow","postalCode":"121471","phone":"(7-495)785-39-07","website":"http:\/\/www.ochakovo.ru\/","latitude":55.6749595,"longitude":37.4351113,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"RU","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Russian Federation","isoThree":"RUS","numberCode":643,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"F71W8k","name":"Oconomowoc Brewing","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:08","id":"BRCrTl","locality":"Oconomowoc","region":"Wisconsin","latitude":43.11091,"longitude":-88.498129,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"CwxOMu","name":"Odd Side Ales","description":"\u200bWelcome to Odd Side Ales, one of the fastest growing breweries in Michigan.

We have taken a different tack than many new brewers, and rather than going for a number of very big, single batch beers, we are focused on food-friendly beers in a smaller lineup that is readily available year round. We realized a long time ago that food-friendly by no means needs to be less flavorful, and we actually add ingredients to widen the palate of our beers above and beyond their original styles.\r\n\r\nTo better integrate with a meal and make our beers more \u2018sessionable\u2019 in general, we utilize highly attenuating yeasts to dry out our beers to make them less sweet and filling, then replace that desired sweetness with an addition outside the norm, such as Juniper, Ginger or even Angelica. These ingredients are always kept at a level to avoid building a \u2018spice beer\u2019, and always present themselves as a unique and complementary addition. We also focus on extremely clean finishes, and use the entire recipe to build bittering rather than just using the hops to reduce lingering starchiness.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the true beauty of any flavor is in the eye (and mouth) of the beholder.

When Y2K sputtered out before it even came to life, the two had their first discussion about opening a brewery. More life happened. More of the guys\u2019 improving craft beers were served at more home parties. When they got together again more recently, the topic resurfaced, but this time it wouldn\u2019t go away. And gradually a brewery was born.\r\n\r\n20 years since the start of their homebrew hobbies, Odyssey Beerwerks was formed to do the impossible: take an enjoyable hobby of creating fine craft beers and make it into a dreary job, with the benefit of bringing new and exciting hand crafted beers onto our vibrant planet.","website":"http:\/\/www.odysseybeerwerks.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/OdysseyBeerwerks\/app_100265896690345","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_73PUUD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_73PUUD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zMORP4\/upload_73PUUD-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-05 17:24:36","updateDate":"2014-09-10 20:23:19","id":"I4hZZy","streetAddress":"5535 W 56th Ave,","extendedAddress":"Suite 107","locality":"Arvada","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80002","phone":"(303) 421-0772","website":"http:\/\/www.odysseybeerwerks.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"M-Th 3-9\r\nF-Sa 2-10\r\nSu Noon-7","latitude":39.8007911,"longitude":-105.0589359,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-06 20:42:31","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"GPsxRB","name":"OEC Brewing","description":"Ordinem Ecentrici Coctores = Order of the Eccentric Boilers.\r\n\r\nWe are an unusual brewery stemming from neither here nor there.

All shall undergo long maturation times while many others will spend time resting on wood.","website":"http:\/\/oecbrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GPsxRB\/upload_51DFqY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GPsxRB\/upload_51DFqY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GPsxRB\/upload_51DFqY-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-06 16:28:48","updateDate":"2014-08-07 11:23:35","id":"MJozk7","streetAddress":"7 Fox Hollow Rd","locality":"Oxford","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06478","phone":"(203) 295-2831","website":"http:\/\/oecbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Sat:  12:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n","latitude":41.4684694,"longitude":-73.1200339,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-07 11:23:25","updateDate":"2014-08-07 11:23:25","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"zhO2k0","name":"Oettinger Brauerei","website":"http:\/\/oettinger-bier.de\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:20:37","updateDate":"2012-08-16 14:21:39","id":"mBpv9h","streetAddress":"Wolfenb\u00fctteler Stra\u00dfe 33","locality":"Braunschweig","postalCode":"38102","latitude":52.265435,"longitude":10.52736,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-16 14:21:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"9ROe02","name":"Oettinger Brauerei GmbH","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:19:03","updateDate":"2012-08-13 14:31:53","id":"atDMAs","streetAddress":"Brauhausstra\u00dfe 8","locality":"Oettingen in Bayern","region":"Nordrhein-Westfalen","postalCode":"D-86732","latitude":48.951056,"longitude":10.57963,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:47:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"D3s54f","name":"Off Color Brewing","description":"We make beer.

For us, brewing beer began as an excuse to gather with our friends and ruminate on life, philosophy, music, food, and of course, beer. Once we got started, we grew more curious about the brewing process, honing our craft and experimenting with different methods and techniques. Along the way a fundamental question to our process was, how can we do more of this ourselves? Our desire to participate in every step of the grain to glass process led us to open Our Mutual Friend.\r\n\r\nAt OMF, our goal is to use local sources to brew local ales. This is why we malt and roast as much of the grain we use in our beer as we can. As a small maltstery, we have more influence over the quality and freshness of the beers we pour in our taproom, and more opportunities to source our ingredients locally. 100 percent of our barley is grown right here in Colorado. And as much as possible, we source our hops and specialty ingredients from farms in our state. \r\n\r\nPart of what we love about beer is its power to bring people together (hence our name!). We\u2019re excited to be a gathering place in the Five Points neighborhood where locals and visitors alike can meet in camaraderie alongside a quality pint of ale. We believe in the power of neighborly acts and the spirit of neighbors taking care of one another within the local community. We at OMF support and strive for the Denver community to know each other better and enjoy a good pint in the same process. \r\n\r\nWe are excited to see our city developing a local, world-class brewery community, and look forward to building relationships with our friends and neighbors, and collaborating with other breweries to cherish our Denver home and protect our collective local influence.","website":"http:\/\/www.omfmb.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ij1ASf\/upload_nGDJ35-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ij1ASf\/upload_nGDJ35-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ij1ASf\/upload_nGDJ35-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-01 13:15:12","updateDate":"2012-12-01 13:16:44","id":"Xz6lr3","streetAddress":"2810 Larimer Street","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80205","phone":"(720) 722-2810","website":"http:\/\/www.omfmb.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSat: 2:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 2:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":39.760595,"longitude":-104.982712,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-01 13:16:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"zuzAcT","name":"Ouray Ale House","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:18","id":"pO4fyo","streetAddress":"215 7th Ave","extendedAddress":"PO Box 630","locality":"Ouray","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"81427","latitude":38.0238746,"longitude":-107.6726745,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"qT6jrj","name":"Ouray Brewery","description":"he Ouray Brewery is  open daily.

It\u2019s often a simple dream, a dream to share his knowledge, his expertise with the ones who call him stranger. And certainly the public may reject his ideas, they may cast him back to where he came from. But does this ever worry the outlander? Never. Because the outlander believes in his ideas. He knows what he is offering is great and he knows others, once they put aside their prejudice, will know this too. He knows that someone who has invested their time, their life, their hopes and dreams behind something cannot fail.

Jay, at this time, owned an old manufacturing warehouse on Cabot Street in Holyoke. He soon incorporated the Paper City Brewery, Co., Inc. From here the wheels were in motion, Jay spent most of his time in transforming the fifth floor of the warehouse into a functional, federally and state approved, micro-brewery. Under the supervision of head brewer Rick Quackenbush the brewery put out its first brew of Holyoke Dam Ale in November of 1996.\r\n\r\nToday, Paper City Brewery continues to grow with the addition of a new Head Brewer Ben Anhalt, Assistant Brewer, Jason Todd and an additional flagship beer, Ireland Parish Golden Ale.

After the abolition of the Neudeck Cloister in 1799, the building was converted into a penitentiary. Franz Xaver Zacherl, the brewer, purchased the former cloister brewery and continued the Starkbier tradition with the product Salvator, which is latin for Saviour. In 1861 the Salvatorkeller (Salvator cellar) was opened upon Nockherberg. In 1928 the brewery merged with the Gebr\u00fcder Thomas brewery creating Paulaner Salvator Thomas Br\u00e4u. 1994 saw the acquisition into the Kulmbacher brewery group with the affiliated producers Plauen and Chemnitz. A daughter company is the Auer Br\u00e4u AG Rosenheim. Paulaner belongs to the BHI (Brau Holding International AG), a joint venture between Sch\u00f6rghuber Ventures (50.1%) and with Holland's Heineken N.V.

And while we spent the first 8 years slinging brews out to nearby pubs and restaurants in draught kegs only, in July of 2007, we unveiled bottled beer in six packs and cases.","website":"http:\/\/www.pearlstreetbrewery.com\/brewin\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LWD44j\/upload_eTeauY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LWD44j\/upload_eTeauY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LWD44j\/upload_eTeauY-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2012-04-11 12:26:08","id":"Y6z24E","streetAddress":"1401 Saint Andrew Street","locality":"La Crosse","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54603","phone":"608-784-4832","website":"http:\/\/www.pearlstreetbrewery.com\/brewin\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue - Fri: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 5:00 am","latitude":43.834352,"longitude":-91.236154,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"ELJRna","name":"Pearl Street Grill & Brewery","description":"The Pearl Street Grill & Brewery features a full-grain brewhouse right in the main dining room.

At Philadelphia Brewing Co we take pride in our brews, our people, and our community. One person could never do everything that it takes to get beer into your glass. And it may sound obvious, but we won't brew anything that we wouldn't drink ourselves - you won't catch us drinking anything called Ultra unless it's a literal name meaning more flavor, more hops, more malt, more carbs. That's because we are Brewers; proud brewers of fine hand crafted Ales from our historic brewery building in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles. Once we're stocked up on the core brews we'll start pumping out regular seasonal or specialty brews.

The previous owner of the Pig's Eye brands, Minnesota Brewing Company, had gone out of business in June of that year.  We (two former Minnesota Brewing Company employees - Phil Gagne', the Brewmaster, and Jeff Crawford, the VP of Sales) formed Pig's Eye Brewing Company, and purchased the Pig's Eye brands from ... Minnesota Brewing company's creditors in September 2002. \r\n\r\nWith the old brewery closed, and  limited resources at our disposal, we applied for, and received, permission from the Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau to brew as an \"alternating proprietor\" at City Brewing Company - La Crosse, WI; a brewery with a longstanding brewing heritage, and a commitment to quality.  As an \"alternating proprietor\", we are a \"brewery within a brewery\", essentially renting brewing and packaging equipment from City whenever we are brewing and packaging our products.\r\n\r\nOur inaugural brews of Pig's Eye Pilsner and Pig's Eye Light were started on February 18, 2003, with the 1st product run was on March 25, 2003.  To the chagrin of some of our loyal customers, we made the decision to drop the \"Pirate\" rendering of \"Pig's Eye\" from our packaging, in favor of a historically accurate portrayal of Pierre \"Pig's Eye\" Parrant.  In May 2004, in response to consumer interest in low-carb products, we replaced Pig's Eye Light with Pig's Eye Lean Light (the original Pig's Eye light beer).  Our product line expanded again in January 2006 - with the introduction of Pit Bull High Gravity Ice Malt Liquor, and again in June 2007 - with the re-introduction of Pig's Eye Ice.  We  also, for a short period of time, operated as an alternating proprietorship and packaged 24\/12 Returnable Bottles at Stevens Point Brewery- Stevens Point, WI, but had to discontinue the production of the returnable bottle package due to increases in packaging costs. \r\n\r\nWe started out in 2002 as a 2 man owner\/operator brewer, and remain so to this day.

The brewing began in a small apartment kitchen on Pine St. in San Francisco on a stove that could hardly generate a boil. During the first night, it became apparent that we could create the beer that we wanted to drink and the collective that became Pine Street Brewery (PSB) was born. That was goal from the first night of brewing\u2014it was love at first smell.\r\n\r\nPSB moved into the historic Bourne Mansion in Pacific Heights during the Spring of 2010 and called this home until the Fall of 2011. Regular weekly brewing led to lots of experimentation and ten recipes that have become part of the core beer list. During \u201cBrew Nights,\u201d friends were made, a community was fostered and a brand was started.\r\n\r\nPine Street Brewery was designed so that our products would be available for many different palates in many different communities. There is a unique Pine Street in almost every area. We intend for our beer, interpretations of classic styles, to unite people across the US, one beer at a time.\r\n\r\nOur philosophy is to provide a celebration through ales and togetherness.

What started as a weekend cookout has grown into the world's largest western steakhouse with seating for 1800 people inside and outside for 2000.\r\n\r\nPinnacle Peak Patio is renowned for its delicious mesquite broiled steaks, casual western atmosphere, and its \"NO NECKTIE POLICY.\" This \"no necktie\" tradition was started one night when a Phoenix executive came in for dinner. The original owner, wanting to keep the atmosphere in his restaurant casual, told the executive, \"Either you take that tie off, or I'll cut it off.\" The executive did not take heed and was appalled when the owner pulled out a butcher knife and promptly cut off the offending cravat.\r\n\r\nWanting to be recognized as a victim of this absurd policy, the executive demanded that his tie be prominently displayed for all to see. The necktie was stapled to the rafters along with a business card identifying its victim. Pinnacle Peak is very serious about its \"no necktie\" policy and has cut over a million ties from unsuspecting customers.","website":"http:\/\/pppatio.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Neba3O\/upload_OLyV4w-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Neba3O\/upload_OLyV4w-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Neba3O\/upload_OLyV4w-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-09 21:44:30","id":"5efIdI","streetAddress":"10426 East Jomax Road","locality":"Scottsdale","region":"Arizona","postalCode":"85255","phone":"1-480-563-5133","latitude":33.7268223,"longitude":-111.8531069,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"zyKOCp","name":"Pint's Pub Brewery and Freehouse","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:08","id":"hyO6mj","streetAddress":"211 West 13th Avenue","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80204","phone":"1-303-534-7543","latitude":39.7368792,"longitude":-104.9905269,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"CrwYzN","name":"Pinthouse Pizza","description":"Pinthouse Pizza is a craft brewpub serving Austin's finest pizza and world class beers.

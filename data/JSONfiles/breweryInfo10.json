In 1981 he received the recognition he deserved in the form of the first (on Premises) brewing License ever awarded in Australia. He then set about setting up the first Pub Brewery.\r\n\r\nIn 1987, Scharer opened George IV Inn in Picton where we tapped his traditional style perfected brews. This huge step paved the way for many of the fantastic craft beers now brewed and enjoyed throughout Australia today.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1990\u2019s Scharer operated and lived in the Australian Hotel in The Rocks where his famed ales (Lager and Bock) were the only beers on tap. If one was to ask for a different mainstream beer, they would be told upfront \u2018we don\u2019t sell that shit here\u2019 and moved onto the next pub down the road. Geoff was a larrikin and larger than life itself.\r\n\r\nIn the early 2000\u2019s Geoff sold the pub and brewery on one condition \u2018the recipes never changed\u2019 and to this day \u2013 they haven\u2019t.\r\n\r\nIn May 2012, Geoff the man known as \u2018one of the Grandfathers of Australian Craft beer\u2019 passed away in his sleep. A huge loss of one of the legends of the industry; his legacy will forever live on in his beers.","website":"http:\/\/www.scharers.com.au","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s3OJNh\/upload_C8GtgM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s3OJNh\/upload_C8GtgM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s3OJNh\/upload_C8GtgM-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-02-07 12:42:01","id":"S8Vx8T","streetAddress":"180 Old Hume Hwy","locality":"Picton","region":"NSW","postalCode":"2571","phone":"+61 2 4677 1415","latitude":-34.319477,"longitude":150.577972,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AU","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"L7sF9R","name":"Schaumburger Privat-Brauerei","website":"http:\/\/www.schaumburger-brauerei.de\/","established":"1873","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:18:44","updateDate":"2012-08-13 01:07:10","id":"ZG4LpG","streetAddress":"St. Annen 11","locality":"Stadthagen","region":"Niedersachsen","postalCode":"31655","latitude":52.315405,"longitude":9.201404,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:47:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"whYakt","name":"Scheldebrouwerij","description":"One of few breweries that still brew their beers the authentic way.

For more than 400 years the brewery has been taking care that the local traditional beers are supplied regionally as well as internationally.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer important how advanced we are and how much technical support we use during our daily processes. The most important aspect for us is that we keep our traditional heritage. As we know the saying \"New is not in comparison with the word better\".\r\n\r\nThe Schlossbrauerei Au-Halltertau respects the tradition and heritage of quality traditional premium brewing. For more than 400 years the brewery has been taking care that the local traditional beers are supplied regionally as well as internationally. The first documented brew master was the royal court brew master named \"Schweiger\" in 1590. At that time the Noble Freiherr Baron von Thurn was the lord of the castle. He was the fourth noble lord since 990 a.d through 1281 a.d that ruled in Au Hallertau.\r\n\r\nSince 1846 the Noble rulers and Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz have ruled and resided in the magnificent \"Moated Castle\" in Au i.d. Hallertau.\r\n\r\nThe noble family of Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz is still living in the castle an in the meantime it is the 6th generation.\r\n\r\nAt present Baron Freiherr Beck von Peccoz is making sure that the Castle Brewery stays a traditional brewery together with the necessary vision into the future to create a sustainable traditional premium quality future.\r\n\r\nMichael Baron Freiherr Beck von Peccoz\u2019s utmost desire is not to miss a successful sustainable future and at the same time to keep up the 6 generations of writing a successful historical event for the Castle brewery and it history.\r\n\r\nThe Brew Master Mr. Stefan Ebensperger is supporting the Baron with his highly qualified experience and skills. The necessary emotions and bindings towards a brewing heritage that has been passed down for generations is needed. Tradition is naturally one of the highest priorities for Mr. Ebensperger due to our traditional purity laws dating back to 1516 a.d therefore you can be assured that the quality is a premium German and he says, \"It will also stay like that\". Since 1516 the Bavarians have known how important the quality of the ingredients and the brewing process actually are. Beer was known during the Middle Ages as the same significant value as bread. As a part of the staple die, it was also germ free and full of healthy calories. During that time the average citizen spent a good 20 percent of their income on beer.\r\n\r\nOn the 23. April 1516 the Bavaria Duke Wilhelm IV. Executed and introduced the famous Bavarian Purity law into the Bavarian Parliament in Ingolstadt with the famous words: \"Just like beer in Summer an in winter as well as the county or province it is brewed or served\" Since that day it is prohibited to brew beer for the German market with anything else apart from hops, malt, water and yeast. In 1918 the Weimarer Republik accepted the Bavarian purity law into its republic, therefore the Bavarian purity then became a German law. Under the purity law or Bavaria and Germany the Castle Brewery, inspects, insures and stores all its quality premium beers as in the past historical way the Castle Lords and Brew Masters did.","website":"http:\/\/www.auer-bier.de\/","established":"1590","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_YbYgau-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_YbYgau-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HJTHzW\/upload_YbYgau-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

Recently, Rick Bouke took over as Brewmaster, and is responsible for the high quality and craft beer character our customers have come to expect. Sequoia's menu offers great food with the freshest ingredients, serves Certified Angus Beef, prepares their sauces and items from scratch and offers fresh daily fish.\r\n\r\nSequoia offers a menu for all ages in a warm and comfortable atmosphere, where everyone knows your name. Sequoia is a hot spot for live music featuring the best local bands and a private party room.

Signature Brew brings them both together. Music provides the drive for making beers that are challenging, engaging and refreshing.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost we want to make beers, inspired by music, that we are proud of and love drinking. That is the beginning and end, of why we run Signature Brew, but let\u2019s fill you in on the inbetween...\r\n\r\nSignature Brew began life as a three man (Dave, Tom & Sam) crusade against the monotonous nature of the beer at all the gigs we had played, and been to, over the years. When the music on stage was a labor of love and art, we didn\u2019t want to enjoy it with passionless, uninspiring and insipid lagers.\r\n\r\nIn 2011 we began trying to change this. We spoke to a few bands we knew to see if they\u2019d be interested in brewing with us (they were), and so we set about taking our home brewing to a commercial level.\r\n\r\nThe new \u2018Signature Brew : Originals\u2019 range launched in 2014, crossing musical and beer boundaries. Taking creative control for ourselves and using our experience from the last 3 years to make beers that everyone will enjoy and appreciate.","website":"http:\/\/www.signaturebrew.co.uk\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/signaturebrew.us5.list-manage.com\/subscribe\/post?u=bd9eb29df5db1ee7ef7fe5b3b&amp;id=9ccdbc66df","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hz694U\/upload_Gklh7r-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hz694U\/upload_Gklh7r-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hz694U\/upload_Gklh7r-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-21 13:53:23","updateDate":"2014-10-29 15:40:22","id":"qKkgtq","name":"Workshop 45","streetAddress":"Hackney Downs Studios","region":"London","postalCode":"E82BT","phone":"442076844664","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"office","locationTypeDisplay":"Office","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-29 15:37:16","updateDate":"2014-10-29 15:37:16","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"C6EUeD","name":"Sigtunabryggerier","website":"http:\/\/www.sigtunabrygghus.se\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-02 21:44:48","updateDate":"2014-02-09 12:28:37","id":"hJaj9K","streetAddress":"Pionj\u00e4rv\u00e4gen 2","region":"Arlandastad","postalCode":"19542","phone":"08 \u2013 591 21 400","website":"http:\/\/sigtunabrygghus.se\/","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"SE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-09 12:29:28","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Sweden","isoThree":"SWE","numberCode":752,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"Pb4Zwl","name":"Siletz Roadhouse & Brewery","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:09","id":"uu9g7A","streetAddress":"243 North Gaither Street","locality":"Siletz","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97380","phone":"1-541-444-2335","latitude":44.7220205,"longitude":-123.9180432,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"tIgHYj","name":"Silver City Restaurant & Brewery","description":"Steve and I got into business together in 1990 when we opened our first restaurant, Top Notch Burger, in East Bremerton.

We had fun and we still have Silver City Guests ask us about 39 cent hamburgers and grilled onion burgers. We miss 'em too, but we proved it's real hard to put the big hamburger chains out of business. It isn't as easy as it looks.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 we decided to switch gears and get into the Brewpub business. We sold our Bremerton location and remodeled the Silverdale location into what it is today.\r\n\r\nWe operate today on the same principles as we did when we opened our first Top Notch Burger.

During its heyday, the Skagway Brewing Company and its brew master Herman Barthel, the most technologically adorned brewer on the West coast, produced up to 30,000 barrels of beer per year and had a bottling operation on site. Multiple breweries operated out of Skagway during the peak of the Gold Rush and by 1900 competition was fierce amongst them. With the Skagway economy on a decline due to the fervor of the gold rush ending and growing prohibition support, the Skagway Brewing Company closed its doors in 1904. In 1916, the \u201cAlaska Bone Dry Law\u201d was passed effectively ending the making and consumption of alcoholic beverages in the Territory of Alaska.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, a local entrepreneur reopened the Skagway Brewing Co. in the Golden North Hotel until 2002 when it again ceased operations. With the brewing tanks collecting dust and locals thirsty for microbrews, South Dakota native and long time Skagway resident, Michael Healy spotted an opportunity and bought the equipment in 2007. Operating in a brand new building, the Skagway Brewing Company again fired up the brew tanks and on July 4th, 2007 opened its doors once again much to the pleasure of locals and visitors alike. This bustling business keeps growing, frantically brewing to keep up with the high demand of its brews and quality-dining menu.

Prior to its formation, Dave Fox launched and operated the Skull Coast Ale Company, a limited liability company (LLC.), located in Fort Mill, South Carolina, organized in 2009. Without the investment dollars needed to start his own brewery, the Skull Coast Ale Company operated as a \u201cContract Brewing\u201d or \u201cBeer Marketing\u201d company, in craft beer terms. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, the company contracted with other breweries to produce its beer recipes, and marketed the products under the Skull Coast name.\r\n\r\nAfter months of recipe development and searching for a brewery to contract with, Dave Fox brewed Skull Coast's first beer on St. Patrick's Day, 2010, in Virginia. The result was Maelstrom IPA; a true west coast style India Pale Ale, aggressively hopped with seven different Northwest hops. After months of traveling back and forth between South Carolina and Virginia to brew and transport kegs (roughly seven hours each way), Dave sought out a second contract brewing relationship closer to home. Unfortunately, every Carolina brewery Dave approached was at or near capacity. Undeterred, Dave created his own capacity. In the first of its kind contract model, Dave purchased his own 60bbl fermenter and bright tanks, and placed them in another brewery.\r\n\r\nThe Skull Coast Brewing Company is the continuation of a lifelong dream. The brand was born in a small Charleston library after looking at a local map drawn in the 1700's, during the Golden Age of Piracy, with the words \"Skull Coast\" etched along the Carolina coastline. The Skull Coast products matured and our understanding of the beer business was developed during our contract brewing experience, under the Skull Coast Ale Company. Now, with a new entity, our own facility and unrestricted in our growth, the Skull Coast Brewing Company hopes to become a lifelong part of your history.","website":"http:\/\/skullcoastales.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_8OZR9o-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_8OZR9o-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HX4Prz\/upload_8OZR9o-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2012-04-20 19:10:08","id":"kXV5lc","streetAddress":"802 Somerton Drive","locality":"Fort Mill","region":"South Carolina","postalCode":"29715","phone":"803-619-9295","latitude":35.011366,"longitude":-80.956275,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"TjzLgu","name":"Hickory Location","streetAddress":"883 Highland Ave SE","locality":"Hickory","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28602","latitude":35.735156,"longitude":-81.325672,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-20 18:52:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"pGCPld","name":"Sky High Brewing & Pub","description":"You've noticed the sky reaching beams coming out of the old Avalon Cinema building...

Our mission is to brew unique, ingredient-driven beers that challenge common notions of what a beer should taste like.

The Somerville Brewing Company contracts with regional breweries to make the best recipes for wide-spread commercial release, but each recipe is an evolving process of refinement. This model for beer production provides an opportunity to experiment with innovative local ingredients to produce craft beers that stand apart from typical formulations.","website":"http:\/\/www.slumbrew.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_BJqSCO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_BJqSCO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_BJqSCO-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-13 00:30:15","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:20","id":"pATY6L","locality":"Somerville","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02144","phone":"1-800-428-1150","website":"http:\/\/www.slumbrew.com\/","latitude":42.402309,"longitude":-71.120132,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-13 00:36:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"ZlJrSJ","name":"Sommerbecker Brauerei GbR","website":"http:\/\/www.sommerbecker-dachs.de\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:18:45","updateDate":"2012-08-16 15:10:41","id":"E8u8xa","streetAddress":"Klein Sommerbeck 4","region":"Dahlenburg","postalCode":"21368","latitude":53.201076,"longitude":10.678317,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-16 15:10:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"mrLL4r","name":"Sonnet 43 Brew House","description":"An increasingly popular brewery from Coxhoe near Durham in the North East of England.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

After 16 years of making great beer in the Bay Area, we have grown by leaps and bounds, yet we still produce many of our beers on the original steam-fired brewhouse that started it all.","website":"http:\/\/www.goodbeer.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QPe57Z\/upload_t8ClLn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QPe57Z\/upload_t8ClLn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QPe57Z\/upload_t8ClLn-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2013-08-09 12:26:41","id":"t559gG","streetAddress":"1195-A Evans Avenue","locality":"San Francisco","region":"California","postalCode":"94124","phone":"415-642-3371","website":"http:\/\/www.goodbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu:\t9:00 am - 10:00 am\r\nFri - Sat:\t12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":37.7382569,"longitude":-122.3802492,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"9c8L2r","name":"Spearhead Brewing Company","description":"Founded in 2011 by Dimitri van Kampen, Spearhead Brewing Company is a family-run craft brewery located in Toronto, Canada.

He chose the site of an ancient monastery, St Francis Abbey in Kilkenny City, to position his brewery. John was inspired by a tradition of brewing on this site, the foundations of which were laid four centuries earlier. Back in the 13th century the Franciscans established an Abbey, with its own well, on the banks of the River Nore in Kilkenny. Whilst brewing and barley cultivation are recorded in Irish Annals from the mists of time, the strong brewing tradition that exists in Kilkenny started with these monks who would have brewed their own light ale for their visitors, using water from St Francis' Well. To this day the Abbey stands proudly at the heart of the brewery and continues to inspire our brewers.","website":"http:\/\/www.smithwicks.ie\/","established":"1710","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/basAdv\/upload_DNmXuc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/basAdv\/upload_DNmXuc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/basAdv\/upload_DNmXuc-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2012-07-25 18:54:01","id":"FRXKiy","locality":"Kilkenny Co.","region":"Kilkenny","phone":"+353 (0)56 779 64 98","latitude":52.651194,"longitude":-7.251514,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IE","yearOpened":"1710","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Ireland","isoThree":"IRL","numberCode":372,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"ujtlp3","name":"St. Francis Brewery","description":"Saint Francis Brewery opened in the Spring of 2009 to great popularity and success.\r\n\r\nKnown for our hand-crafted beers,  Brewmaster Scott Hettig has built upon our foundation of five beers:  Kolsch, Amber Ale, Nut Brown Ale, Weiss and Oatmeal Stout to feature a Bohemian Pilsner, Double Red Ale, Belgian Triple and many more.\r\n\r\nThese wonderful beers are complimented by the great food Executive Chef Ron Wolf creates.

After several years of apprenticing with other master brewers, Mark was ready to begin crafting beer using his own recipes.\r\n\r\nHe found the perfect spot in Charlottesville, VA; a historic storefront on Main Street that was once home to the state of Virginia\u2019s first craft brewing operation. In September 1999, Mark re-opened the doors and introduced the Starr Hill Brewery. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its historic building with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall, and it was there that Mark's delicious craft beers became a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world. Nineteen prestigious awards later, Mark\u2019s brews continue to be a hit at beer and music festivals nationwide.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, in response to the growing demand, Mark moved from this small brewing operation to a larger brewing facility several miles outside of town, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's core and seasonal brews are now enjoyed in restaurants and music clubs throughout the Mid Atlantic and Southeast, and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores in the region.\r\n\r\nMark is proud of the awards his microbrews have earned, and the experts agree that he is among the best craft brewers in the country. But at the end of the day, what still matters most to Mark and his team of brewers at Starr Hill is giving people the gift of great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.starrhill.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4TuN55\/upload_zLn8EZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4TuN55\/upload_zLn8EZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4TuN55\/upload_zLn8EZ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-09-10 14:43:54","id":"HZvqhd","streetAddress":"5391 Three Notch'D Road","locality":"Crozet","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22932","phone":"434-823-5671","website":"http:\/\/www.starrhill.com\/","latitude":38.0692617,"longitude":-78.6866452,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-09-10 18:18:10","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"Hdz6Zk","name":"Starrlight Mead","description":"After several years as home mead makers, we are thrilled to be opening Starrlight Mead.

Several years later, we found friends that were home brewing mead with good results. We decided to try our hand at it too.\r\n\r\nIn February 2006, we entered our first competition and took Best in Show out of over 210 entries in the home mead-maker category at the International Mead Association\u2019s Mead Festival. The competition was judged by seven professionals in the mead industry; including Ken Schramm, author of The Compleat Mead Maker, and meadery owners from around the world. The Best in Show prize was selected from the gold medal winners in nine categories. Our \u201cStarrlight Mulled Apple Cyser\u201d was awarded not only the gold medal in the cyser (mead made with apples) category, but was also selected as the best overall representation of mead making. It was at that point we decided to try creating a business from our love of mead.\r\n\r\nBen shares his expertise and love of brewing by conducting demonstrations and workshops on mead making in the local community.

In 1848, during the German Revolution, Bernhard Stroh, having apprenticed at his father side, immigrated to the United States. He established his own brewery in Detroit in 1850. Stroh named his new company Lion's Head Brewery, adopting the Lion's Crest logo from the Kyrburg Castle in Germany \u2013 the same crest that adorns Stroh beers today\r\n\r\nAfter establishing the brewery, Bernhard's son, Bernhard Jr., continued its expansion. A firm proponent of tradition and quality, he introduced the European method of fire-brewing to America. The fire-brewing process uses a direct flame rather than steam to heat beer-filled copper kettles. The resulting higher temperatures intensify the aroma and body of beer, resulting in a more flavorful brew.\r\n\r\nDuring Prohibition, the Stroh family operated the business under the name The Stroh Products Company, producing near beer (beer with its alcohol extracted), birch beer, soft drinks, malt products, ice cream, and ice. Though production of most of these items ceased when Prohibition ended in 1933, Stroh Ice Cream can still be enjoyed at parlors today.\r\n\r\nThe Stroh Brewery grew alongside the other titans of Detroit industry. In 1964 the company made its first move toward expansion when it bought the Goebel Brewing Company, with an eye towards national distribution. As other national brands began to enter the Detroit market, Stroh began to aggressively pursue other markets.\r\n\r\nIn 1973, Peter Stroh's willingness to depart from years of tradition enabled Stroh's to survive, but the changes were hard to swallow for many Stroh's employees. Stroh broke the company's tradition of family management and recruited managers from other companies. He also introduced a light beer, Stroh's Light.\r\n\r\nThough the brewery encountered many difficult times, the tradition and quality of Stroh's has never changed, and the quality of Bernhard's family-owned beer continue today, with Stroh's and Stroh's Light.","website":"http:\/\/www.strohbeer.com\/","established":"1850","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uV6ou7\/upload_dng2E8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uV6ou7\/upload_dng2E8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uV6ou7\/upload_dng2E8-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2012-08-01 12:14:51","id":"9LfmKk","locality":"Tampa","region":"Florida","latitude":27.94653,"longitude":-82.459269,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"Zwlamt","name":"Strong Arm Brewing","description":"We love beer!

After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in.

However, they quickly realized their love of baseball was more than equaled by their love of a good drink. Despite the desolate landscape of college get-togethers where there was a strong emphasis on a drink's quantity over quality, Wilson and Tommy were able to find a shared interest in the craft beer industry. When they started an alcoholic beverage company, their adventurous attitudes translated into a desire to create a product that was truly new and exciting. The result was T.W. Pitchers\u2019 Snake Bite\u00ae.\r\n\r\nWhile in college, Wilson lived in Europe and discovered that generations of British pub-goers have enjoyed blending lager and hard apple cider. He was astonished to learn the popular concoction had only sparingly made its way across the pond to the United States. Ready to undo this injustice, he returned from his trip and founded W.G. Barr Beverage Company. Tommy was brought on board, and the dynamic duo got to work bringing Snake Bite \u2013 a bottled blend of lager and cider - to the thirsty people of America. T.W. Pitchers\u2019, which stands for \"Two Williams Pitchers\u2019,\" or \"Tommy and Wilson, Pitchers,\" was immediately settled on as the brand name.\r\n\r\nAfter months of hard work and many late nights spent taste testing, Wilson and Tommy launched T.W.

The story goes, Wesley was approached by his father, Tim, one day about what he was going to do with his life. As an ocean lifeguard and co-owner of a bar, Wesley thought he had it made. His dad informed him of a trademark he had won in 2004 and subsequently protected in contest from Anheuser Busch. The name was TailGate Beer.\r\n\r\nTim thought TailGate Beer was something special. As an avid sports fan and tailgater, Tim implored Wesley to take his homebrews that people loved drinking and brew TailGate Beer! Wesley, having put himself through college at San Diego State University, grew up modestly. The gift of TailGate Beer was a generous one but, unlike some tales of entrepreneurism, didn\u2019t come with startup funds.\r\n\r\nThey both agreed the name was solid and the marketing would one day be fun, but Wesley was emphatic that the beer had to be excellent. From there, Wesley took what he liked to brew, and brewed in Southern California. All initial beers were brewed and packaged in kegs and glass bottles. Wesley entered into the Great American Beer Festival in 2007 and although no formal awards were won, TailGate Beer was a hit! This drew lots of attention from beer fans from all over the country. The common response was \u201cgreat beer!\u201d and \u201cgreat name!\u201d So with confirmation of Wesley\u2019s biggest apprehension \u2013 people loved the beer \u2013 TailGate Beer was born.","website":"http:\/\/www.tailgatebeer.com\/","established":"2007","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/tailgatebeer.com\/tailgate-newsletter\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_jjOm6o-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_jjOm6o-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_jjOm6o-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2013-08-16 01:31:05","id":"XqWTM7","name":"TailGate Beer","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","phone":"858-215-4842","website":"http:\/\/www.tailgatebeer.com","latitude":32.7153292,"longitude":-117.1572551,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"2E7Ndx","name":"Taiwan Tobacco & Liquor Corporation","website":"http:\/\/en.ttl.com.tw\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2013-05-10 18:07:14","id":"AAFHVY","streetAddress":"No. 4, Sec. 1, Nanchang Rd","locality":"Jhongjheng District","region":"Taipei City","postalCode":"100","phone":"886 02-2321-4567","website":"http:\/\/en.ttl.com.tw\/","latitude":25.0314665,"longitude":121.5170711,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"TW","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","isoCode":"TW","name":"TAIWAN, PROVINCE OF CHINA","displayName":"Taiwan, Province of China","isoThree":"TWN","numberCode":158,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"b3TGSz","name":"Tall Tales Brewery","description":"We are a small, premium brewery based in Parsonsburg, MD.

The brewery is located in the West Bank village of Taybeh, 35 kilometers north of Jerusalem. It produced its first beer in 1995 and has since developed a global cult following. It has been described as a pioneer microbrewery in the region, being that it predated the first Israeli microbrewery, The Dancing Camel, by about ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilestones:\r\nBy 2005 the company was only able to produce 300 cases a week locally due to conflict with Israel. Taybeh beer sold in Europe is brewed and bottled in Belgium with the license held in Germany.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, an annual Oktoberfest-style beer festival was launched. Dubbed the Taybeh Beer Festival, it opens in the beginning of October.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Taybeh beer became the first Palestinian product to be franchised in Germany, where it was brewed and bottled for sale in Europe. Taybeh beer is also exported directly from Taybeh to Sweden.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, an Australian named Lara van Raay produced a documentary called Palestine, Beer and Oktoberfest Under Occupation, which focuses on the Taybeh Brewery and the Khoury family.\r\n\r\n\r\nProducts:\r\nThere are four varieties of Taybeh Beer: Golden, Light, Amber, and Dark. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, a new non-alcoholic beer variety was to be launched specifically for the local Palestinian Muslim market. \r\n\r\nThe original brand was Taybeh Beer Golden. The Taybeh Beer Dark and Taybeh Beer Light were introduced for the 2000 celebrations in the Holy Land. The Dark variety follows a classic style of the way monks brewed beer in the Middle Ages in order to fortify themselves during their fasting.","website":"http:\/\/www.taybehbeer.net\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-30 19:57:58","updateDate":"2012-07-30 21:47:14","id":"y8m51D","streetAddress":"Taybeh, Ramallah","locality":"West Bank","region":"Palestine","latitude":31.899205,"longitude":35.203356,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IL","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-30 21:53:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Israel","isoThree":"ISR","numberCode":376,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"tBHo6G","name":"Taylor Brewing","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:09","id":"xfCBBL","streetAddress":"717 East Butterfield Road","locality":"Lombard","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60148","phone":"1-630-990-8700","latitude":41.839699,"longitude":-87.998863,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearClosed":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"VV0cFh","name":"Taylor's Crossing Brewing","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:09","id":"ZyuzKm","streetAddress":"1025 Marine Drive","locality":"North Vancouver","region":"British Columbia","phone":"1-604-984-2739","latitude":49.3236808,"longitude":-123.1025507,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"7ojQP8","name":"Taylor's Restaurant and Brewery","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:09","id":"CIdnUD","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","latitude":32.715695,"longitude":-117.161719,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"Kh9m9D","name":"Teague Hollow Brewing","website":"http:\/\/thbrewery.blogspot.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Kh9m9D\/upload_IxZvPe-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Kh9m9D\/upload_IxZvPe-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Kh9m9D\/upload_IxZvPe-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-21 23:30:35","updateDate":"2012-07-21 23:30:36","id":"w0NZ2Y","locality":"Montgomery","region":"Alabama","latitude":32.38012,"longitude":-86.300629,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-21 23:32:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"3JrTod","name":"Ted's Cervecer\u00eda","description":"Teds Brewery offers 2 special high fermentation beers.

Tim's background in brewing started in his college days at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. In early 1993, his roommate at the time introduced him to the art of making beer. This smalltime hobby of making beer in a tiny apartment blossomed into a fulltime career, brewing commercially. Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern California to study Fermentation Science. Upon returning to Salt Lake, he aligned himself with a startup brewery called Uinta Brewing Company. The concept for this startup was to brew the freshest beer available in the State of Utah while limiting the alcohol percentage to 3.2 by weight (4% by volume).

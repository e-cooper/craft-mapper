The brewery won four national awards in its first year of operation, and has continued to win awards each year. Our Rock Chuck Rye has won gold medals in both the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Cup. \r\n\r\nWhile sampling tasty brews in the stylish pub and inhaling the hoppy aroma of beer-brewing in progress, you can can enjoy tasty food from the Cowfish menu. In the summer our outdoor decks provide a beer garden like atmosphere under the shade of a hundred year old pine tree or this year\u2019s crop of cascade hops. Looking for something more casual, order your beer next door at the historic Lander Bar while feasting on one of the Gannett Grill\u2019s signature burgers or hand tossed New York style pizzas.\r\n\r\nOur brewmaster Ted Briggs got his start at the Tun Tavern in Atlantic City, then moved west. Chris Erickson, former \u201cbrewmaster of the year\u201d shared his knowledge and recipies with Ted and the results are amazing. If you spot Ted stirring his elixir in the copper tanks with his wooden paddle, checking his dials, ask him for a tour of the brewery.

Our brewing process utilizes the traditional English method of upward infusion mashing in our combination mash lauter tun to create lagers and ales inspired by old world values, but with modern quality and consistency. The staff at The Lion Brewery is dedicated to producing true handcrafted beers, made right here in our century-old Brewhouse. All of our premium beers are made using only the four basic ingredients allowed by the Reinheitsgebot, or German purity law. Under the skillful supervision of our Master Brewer, Leo Orlandini, each of our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches using only the finest hops and malts available to guarantee the highest quality and freshness. Each product we brew is an original recipe especially created to deliver a fuller flavor than ordinary beers, yet with an approachable style and character. As a result, our beers have garnered numerous medals from the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Championships in recent years.\r\n\r\nIn 1974 the Lion Brewing Company bought the Stegmaier Brand.","website":"http:\/\/www.lionbrewery.com\/","established":"1857","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_E6dFnP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_E6dFnP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_E6dFnP-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2013-05-10 01:58:10","id":"z0gnmN","streetAddress":"700 North Pennsylvania Blvd.","locality":"Wilkes Barre","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18705","phone":"800-233-8327","website":"http:\/\/www.lionbrewery.com\/","latitude":41.2556575,"longitude":-75.858261,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1857","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"jgmC2v","name":"Lion Bridge Brewing Company","description":"Lion Bridge Brewing Company is a 10-barrel brewery located on the property of the former Fritz\u2019s Food Market at 59 16th Avenue SW (Czech Village in Cedar Rapids, Iowa).","website":"http:\/\/www.lionbridgebrewing.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jgmC2v\/upload_hbaCkH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jgmC2v\/upload_hbaCkH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jgmC2v\/upload_hbaCkH-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-07 14:57:16","updateDate":"2014-08-08 10:43:06","id":"4E9qej","streetAddress":"59 16th Ave SW","locality":"Cedar Rapids","region":"Iowa","postalCode":"52404","phone":"(319) 200-4460","website":"http:\/\/lionbridgebrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\n\n","latitude":41.9650801,"longitude":-91.6603498,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-08 10:42:52","updateDate":"2014-08-08 10:42:52","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"6G7SgL","name":"Lion Co","description":"Lion is a leading beverage and food company with a portfolio that includes many of Australia and New Zealand\u2019s favourite brands.

The Steinway piano prominently displayed in the pub was originally brought into the building in 1899. It has never left the building, and is the same piano that was used during the early 20th century to accompany silent films.

builders.\r\n\r\n \r\nWe are grateful for the opportunity to establish our business in historic Wardensville and proud to become a part of the local community.\r\n \r\nWe hope that our artisan craft

Now a year later, Low Brau continues to move forward, with plans to open it's doors within the District in the next year. \r\n\r\nLow Brau's beers are German inspired, following the guidelines set fourth by the Rheinheitsgebot Purity Law and high quality ingredients. Each beer is hand crafted and brewed in small batches to maintain quality over quantity. \r\n\r\nLow Brau strongly believes in \"Embracing Simplicity\".","website":"http:\/\/www.lowbraudc.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3UbArS\/upload_EudZdI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3UbArS\/upload_EudZdI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3UbArS\/upload_EudZdI-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2012-05-17 13:44:58","id":"YglaK6","locality":"Washington","region":"District of Columbia","website":"http:\/\/www.lowbraudc.com\/","latitude":38.89037,"longitude":-77.031959,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"dM7gjl","name":"Lowdown Brewery + Kitchen","description":"LowDown is the culmination of 20+ years of professional brewing experience.

Let\u2019s start a craft beer brewery!\u201d  That Clarity in Thinking, led to the successful launch of Lucid Brewing.\r\n\r\nIn June of 2011, with a year of planning already completed, they realized jumping headfirst into the brewery was the only way they could make their dream a reality.  They quit their day jobs.  \r\n\r\nWith that leap of faith \u2013 and a ton of support from many friends and family \u2013 they started building their brewery from the ground up.  Through the sweltering heat of the 2011 summer, many friends labored side by side with Jon and Eric.  They did it all, start to finish, from digging trenches to assembling the last tank.  So of course they needed a refreshing and light drink to quench their thirst while they toiled away.  They found just the right recipe and brewed their first beer \u2013 AIR.  A beer made to get the job done.  Its slight citrus aroma and flavor, lower ABV and crisp dry finish made this their favorite \u201cgo to\u201d beer.  \r\n\r\nBy October the brewery was complete and cooking.  And in the spirit of the season, Eric and Jon gave thanks to the Brew gods when they made their first deliveries to their first three customers the week of Thanksgiving\u2026 in Jon\u2019s car.  Lucid was on its way!\r\n\r\nAlways keeping an eye on the demand for high quality while quickly catching the craft beer lover\u2019s attention, Lucid assembled a team of dedicated employees and introduced brews to quench their customers\u2019 demands.   AIR, DYNO, FOTO and DUO, along with seasonal and small-batch brews, are quickly becoming Minnesota favorites at local bars and restaurants.  \r\n\r\nGreat success has followed them after throwing away the daily grind for the daily brew.","website":"http:\/\/www.lucidbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"www.LucidBrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_s5bHsF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_s5bHsF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_s5bHsF-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-09-16 13:23:25","id":"1xeovq","streetAddress":"6020 Culligan Way","locality":"Minnetonka","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55345","phone":"612-810-9324","website":"http:\/\/lucidbrewing.wordpress.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu - Fri: 5:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 5:00 pm","latitude":44.895218,"longitude":-93.449725,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"8okeuW","name":"Luckenwalder Spezialit\u00e4ten Brauerei","website":"http:\/\/www.luckenwalder.de\/","established":"1901","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:17:42","updateDate":"2012-08-16 14:03:21","id":"VPzmsA","streetAddress":"Haag 11","locality":"Luckenwalde","postalCode":"14943","latitude":52.091302,"longitude":13.172999,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-16 14:03:44","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"ZhGbaC","name":"Lucky Bucket Brewing Company","description":"After years of working a local brewpub and experimenting in the garage, three guys decided to take their know-how and passion for great beer and bottle it.\r\n\r\nLucky Bucket Brewing Company is Nebraska's newest craft brewery, growing almost as fast as we can brew it.

Some drive across state lines to acquire the finer choices at festivals and suppliers alike, while others exchange trades with those from other states in search of the locally forbidden. But for those who truly take matters into their own hands, homebrewing beer becomes the purest form of gratification.\r\n\r\nDriven by an extreme passion for both innovation and beer, our Brewmaster took what was once just a dream and decided to create a beer that would not only break state laws but also help change the very same laws that Mississippi has let fall behind. For eight years, he brewed beers of many different styles as a hobby - and with each tasting that he would hold at his home, the crowds grew larger. Eventually, he would be convinced that this beer should be available to those patrons who also appreciate the finer beers of the world.\r\n\r\nLucky Town Brewing Company was founded on this very notion \u2013 to craft beers that break boundaries between the working men and women of Mississippi and their wish for locally produced premium beer. With that mission, Lucas Simmons decided to grant those wishes by sharing his passion for crafting beer in 2011.","website":"http:\/\/www.luckytownbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_NKhh2n-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_NKhh2n-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_NKhh2n-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-24 10:51:48","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:20","id":"qUIYuC","streetAddress":"1710 N Mill St","locality":"Jackson","region":"Mississippi","postalCode":"39202","phone":"(601) 201-0988","website":"http:\/\/www.luckytownbrewing.com","latitude":32.319632,"longitude":-90.188048,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-24 10:52:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"KQhDR6","name":"L\u00fcdde Br\u00e4u","website":"http:\/\/www.hotel-brauhaus-luedde.de\/","established":"1992","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:20:16","updateDate":"2012-08-16 12:04:13","id":"ey4s2u","streetAddress":"Blasiistra\u00dfe 14","region":"Quedlinburg","postalCode":"06484","latitude":51.805573,"longitude":11.052451,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-16 12:04:39","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}

Krook's Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000, we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River. In 2003, we added a Stone Pizza Oven and a Sushi Bar to expand our menu selection.

Manorhouses and the beer they produced were unique to families and the communities of which they were a part. We will fulfill all those same criteria. \r\n\r\nManor House Brewing represents an alternative to conventional beer, we are prideful in our local roots and want to inspire pride in our local community. Our beer is an output of a thoughtful creative process and we view what we do as art, not commodity. We experiment with new things, but try to predict the outcome in advance. Every so often, we accidentally stumble upon greatness.\r\n\r\nWhy do we want to brew beer? To satisfy a longing for the simple pleasures and a simpler time. Happiness, joy, and relaxation is our goal.\r\n\r\nHow are we different from every other craft brewer? The very same thing that makes us the same. We are creative, innovative and different. We do not feel compelled to brew to style as we may create our own, but when we do brew to style, we do so with passion.","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:17","id":"JY4SOB","streetAddress":"204 Burnt Meadow Rd","locality":"Ringwood","region":"New Jersey","postalCode":"07456","phone":"973-907-7843","latitude":41.090704,"longitude":-74.318832,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"Lqisex","name":"Mantorville Brewing Company, LLC","description":"Mantorville Brewing Company is located in historic Mantorville, Minnesota.\r\nVisit us for a taste of the old days in this old-time setting.\r\nTours available by appointment only.","website":"http:\/\/www.mantorvillebeer.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Lqisex\/upload_x535L3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Lqisex\/upload_x535L3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Lqisex\/upload_x535L3-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:17","id":"vrnGXc","streetAddress":"101 East Fifth Street","locality":"Mantorville","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55955","phone":"651-387-0708","website":"http:\/\/www.mantorvillebeer.com\/","latitude":44.0674489,"longitude":-92.7408714,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"sRFLYH","name":"Marble Brewery","description":"Marble Brewery is located in the heart of Downtown Albuquerque.

They purchased a small pub called the Freemasons Hotel in Fremantle, Western Australia, installed a brewery and reopened as the Sail & Anchor Hotel. The brewery at the pub enabled the guys to control the quality and presentation of the beers and talk directly to the growing legions of converts.\r\n\r\n \r\nSoon after this the rapidly expanding outfit acquired a property in Nedlands and opened as the Matilda Bay Brewery, producing its main brands Redback & Dogbolter as well as a raft of other specialty craft beers. At the same time the group had an expanding portfolio of hotels including the \u2018Port Melbourne Brewing Co\u2019 operating as the Redback Hotel in Flemington Road, North Melbourne.\r\n \r\nIn 1988 the Brewery again moved to bigger premises, an old renovated Ford factory in Stirling Highway, North Fremantle to continue to cater to the growing demand for Matilda Bay beers. In the early 90s Matilda Bay Brewing Company became a part of the CUB family \u2013 an arrangement that would see the beers reach truly national distribution.\r\n \r\nIn 2007 we relocated to the vibrant craft beer scene in Victoria, and continued brewing first in Dandenong and most recently at an old renovated Cadbury\u2019s chocolate factory in Bertie St Port Melbourne, which includes a bar & restaurant \u2013 so we can again talk directly to our beer lovers.\r\n \r\nThroughout the years we\u2019ve produced some of Australia\u2019s favourite specialty beers & ciders, and along the way bagged a swag of trophies and awards. Our highly regarded Head Brewer \u2013 Scott Vincent \u2013 leads our brewing team with pride as they continue on the mission established in 1984 at the Sail & Anchor Hotel.","website":"http:\/\/www.matildabay.com.au\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lBxrrW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lBxrrW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lBxrrW-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-02-15 12:19:43","id":"NorULV","streetAddress":"89 Bertie Street,","locality":"Port Melbourne","region":"VIC","postalCode":"3207","phone":"(03) 9673 4545","website":"http:\/\/www.matildabay.com.au\/","hoursOfOperation":"Bar\r\nTues \u2013 Thurs: 11am \u2013 10pm\r\nFri \u2013 Sat: 11am \u2013 11pm\r\nKitchen\r\nTues \u2013 Thurs: 12pm \u2013 3pm \/\r\n5pm \u2013 9pm\r\nFri \u2013 Sat: 12pm \u2013 10pm \r\nSun \u2013 Mon : Closed","latitude":-37.8286099,"longitude":144.9371032,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AU","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"fwCFE4","name":"Maui Brewing Co.","description":"Maui Brewing Co., with a brewpub in Kahana and production brewery in Lahaina, has built a reputation for creating handcrafted beers brewed using the finest natural ingredients.

Additionally, our beers are available at all of the restaurants in the historic Oliver House.

We feel at home here and with that comes a responsibility to play a part in the great food and beverage offering.","website":"http:\/\/www.mvbeer.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/cjTheF\/upload_KnEOQR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/cjTheF\/upload_KnEOQR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/cjTheF\/upload_KnEOQR-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-14 17:33:08","updateDate":"2014-02-15 12:28:14","id":"udDKeL","locality":"McLaren Vale","region":"South Australia","postalCode":"5172","phone":"+61 1300 682 337","website":"http:\/\/www.mvbeer.com","latitude":-35.211062,"longitude":138.532265,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AU","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-15 12:27:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"NqX68g","name":"McMenamins Breweries","description":"Since our first brew at the Hillsdale Brewery & Public House in 1985, McMenamins has produced more than 57,600 batches. In 2011 our breweries collectively crafted 3302 batches of beer (including over 250 new and unusual house-specific recipes) more than 47,263 kegs of beer or an astounding 5.8 million pints!\r\n\r\nIn keeping with McMenamins' company philosophy, our breweries believe that brewing \"green\" is brewing responsibly.\r\n\r\nMany beer lovers are familiar with our ales, such as Terminator Stout, Hammerhead, Ruby, Edgefield Wheat, Black Rabbit Porter, Sunflower IPA and others. Read more about these \"standards\" and dozens of others, including our beloved seasonal ales.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of handcrafting, it's safe to say that no two McMenamins batches are identical. Science and technology provide the backbone for our craft, but it is the unique qualities of each brew house, and the individual brewer's ale-crafting style, that ensure you will enjoy liquid refreshments that are truly special and made with every care for the environment.

We\u2019re at the foot of Lookout Mountain just steps away from the world-famous Incline Railway and very near to the great Moccasin Bend of the Tennessee River. \r\n\r\nMBBC was started by two brewers whose quest for the perfect beer led them to learn the art of brewing.  Chris Hunt and Duncan Guy began their brewing education in the Barley Mob Brewers homebrewing club and continued to search for unique and distinctive ale and lager formulas. They decided to offer their creations to the public through a small batch microbrewery in 2006.  Soon thereafter, award-winning brewer Courtney Tyvand joined the two and presented his smoked porter at the brewery\u2019s first beer dinner in October of 2006.\r\n\r\nThe brewery is located on the ground floor of a historic building at 4015 Tennessee Avenue in St. Elmo.  The building is constructed of foot-square cedar timbers and two-foot thick walls made of granite stone and mortar.  Built in 1911 as a packaging factory for K-Rations for WWI, we occasionally find artifacts from that era in the building walls and ceiling.  The brewery shares space with the Chattanooga U-Brew, a brew-on-premises business owned by Greg McCort. \r\n\r\nMBBC is proud to offer small batch specialty ales and lagers in kegs of various sizes.  A tasting room is part of the brewery; samples of our beers can be tasted and tested on premises.  Occasionally we have tasting events or tapping events at the brewery or at a nearby bar or restaurant.

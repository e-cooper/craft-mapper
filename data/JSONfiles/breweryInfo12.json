The brewery is located on the edge of the farms that surround Brothersvalley and Somerset county. Our name comes from \"Whitehorse Mountain\" located right outside of Berlin, where we hunt, play and live.  Whitehorse beers are all natural and made from water, yeast, barley and hops. Some of our seasonal beers will feature natural flavors like brothers valley real maple sugar from our maple trees, and other natural local flavors.\r\n\r\nWe brew beer here because, well we love it and local is how we have always lived. To us Whitehorse isn't part of a new \"slow food movement\" it is just our way of life. We pride ourselves in using as much local product as possible and maintaining our natural rural roots in creating the beers we know you will love.\r\n\r\nAt Whitehorse we believe being environmentally concious and sustainable is important. For example our grains are recycled by giving them to a local farmer who uses it for feed for his livestock which causes no waste into the local environment.\r\n\r\nWe work to ensure our recipes and products are something we love but also you absolutely enjoy and will also appreciate the perfection we put into them. Please enjoy our beers as much as we enjoy creating them.","website":"http:\/\/www.whitehorsebrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kZsjqY\/upload_rMeMpu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kZsjqY\/upload_rMeMpu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kZsjqY\/upload_rMeMpu-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-14 12:41:18","updateDate":"2014-09-16 14:47:55","id":"z1Oq48","streetAddress":"824 Diamond St","locality":"Berlin","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"15530","phone":"(814) 233-3043","website":"http:\/\/Www.whitehorsebrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Thu - Fri: 5:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nSat: 9:00 am - 5:00 pm","latitude":39.926214,"longitude":-78.95578,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-14 12:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"Wcu6yG","name":"Whitstable Brewery","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:10","id":"N60qpz","streetAddress":"Little Telpits Farm, Woodcock Lane","locality":"Maidstone","region":"Kent","phone":"44-(01622)-851007","latitude":51.2738,"longitude":0.525085,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"xyWAj6","name":"Whitstran Pub & Brewing Co","website":"http:\/\/www.whitstranbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:18","id":"zPjezQ","streetAddress":"1427 Wine Country Road","locality":"Prosser","region":"Washington","postalCode":"99350","phone":"509-786-4922","website":"http:\/\/www.whitstranbrewing.com\/","latitude":46.210389,"longitude":-119.769831,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"aIEysX","name":"Whooda Mon Brewery","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:18","id":"bjST8r","locality":"Boulder","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80304","phone":"303-880-8312","latitude":40.041225,"longitude":-105.279109,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"Cbxn1y","name":"Wichita Brewing Company","description":"Wichita Brewing Company offers a welcoming neighborhood brewpub experience, including 9 flat screen televisions to watch your favorite games, friendly staff, and great entertainment.

From that conversation forward there would be no looking back. A business plan was developed and hundreds of test batches brewed. In 2011 Walt and Luke\u2019s lifelong friend Ryan Guthy and his parents Rick and Denise all sat down at their house in the mountains of Western North Carolina to taste some of Luke and Walt\u2019s creations while looking over the plans for what would be Wicked Weed Brewing.  After being thoroughly impressed with the full flavor and vision of the project, the Guthys joined the Dickinsons and the team was assembled.  Over the next months Wicked Weed Brewing found a home at 91 Biltmore avenue, a building that seemed destined to be a brewery.\r\nWith the creativity of Luke, vision of Walt, dedication of Ryan, exquisite taste of Denise and wisdom of Rick a truly unique brewery was born.  So from the humble beginning of a basement, the dream of Wicked Weed Brewing has come to life. Our beer is bold, full of excitement and flavor.  Always focused on drinkability and pushing the boundaries of what we think we are capable of.  Wicked Weed Brewing will always evolve, always grow and always aspire to be greater.

The idea behind the name Wildcard is to pursue the unknown. Wildcard Brewing Company\u2019s owners left stability for chaos, moved to England to learn the craft of beer making, and started a business in an uncertain economy, all in pursuit of a dream. You\u2019d call them crazy, adventurous, unpredictable....a wildcard. Our story is one of the unexpected; a place where there are no limits, where perseverance and a free spirit will turn dreams into reality. \r\n\r\nIt started when Jeff and Jenny brewed two beers to give away as wedding favors at a brewery in San Luis Obispo where they went to college. Homebrew projects and burst bottle explosions ensued in the years after. But a casual passion soon turned career as Jeff and Jenny headed to England. Jeff studied brewing science at the University of Sunderland and Jenny conducted \u201cresearch\u201d in various local pubs. Once back in the states Jeff headed straight for the most competitive brewing location, the Pacific Northwest. Now 4 years later the pair are back in Jeff\u2019s hometown of Redding building out their production brewery.\r\n\r\nWildcard is small startup business focused on brewing flavorful beers and enriching the communities that enjoy them. Spending dollars locally is just a part of that commitment. We will source products and services within 500 miles of our facility as much as possible and intend to exclusively sell beers within that same area. Supporting local businesses not only has great economic impacts but environmental as well. We don\u2019t want to just do business in the Redding community we want to be a part of it. It is important to give back as much as possible to the community and we will make it a point to donate and get involved in local causes and efforts.","website":"http:\/\/www.wildcardbrewingco.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TD4EGg\/upload_DQdvya-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TD4EGg\/upload_DQdvya-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TD4EGg\/upload_DQdvya-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-02 18:23:11","updateDate":"2013-03-02 18:25:15","id":"YbkkwZ","streetAddress":"9565 Crossroads Dr","locality":"Redding","region":"California","postalCode":"96003","phone":"(530) 722-9239","website":"http:\/\/www.wildcardbrewingco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed - Thu: 2:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 12:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 5:00 pm","latitude":40.565865,"longitude":-122.297279,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-02 18:23:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"6rnsGR","name":"Wilde Yaupon Brewing Co","description":"Planned micro-brewery specializing in non-traditional beers, including Lambics, Rauchbier, barrels aged Stouts and Sours.

Its owners, the husband-and-wife team of Peter Ausenhus and Margaret Bishop, have lived near Northwood since their purchase of a nearby farmhouse and acreage in 1998. Nebraska natives, Peter and Margaret lived and worked in Minneapolis for many years before moving to Worth County, where Peter\u2019s grandparents had lived and farmed and where Peter had spent much time as a boy.\r\n\r\n Having already established Margaret\u2019s engineering business in downtown Northwood, the couple turned next to Peter\u2019s passion \u2013 brewing great beer. For 24 years, Peter has brewed award-winning beer, winning contests, teaching others and perfecting classic recipes along the way. He\u2019s a BJCP National Beer Judge, has brewed professionally with Summit Brewing Company of St. Paul, Minn., and worked on staff at one of the country\u2019s most popular brewing supply shops.\r\n\r\nWorth Brewing Company is Peter and Margaret\u2019s way of helping to reintroduce a great tradition \u2013 the locally owned brewery serving hand-crafted, high-quality, distinctive beers for the enjoyment of locals and lucky visitors.

Proud of their product, they were eager to share it with friends. An instant favorite, it wasn't long until they realized their modest homebrewing operation wasn't going to be enough to satisfy the growing demand.\r\n\r\nDuring the early 1990s, many breweries opened, and craft brewing started to gain popularity.

Trying to make tires more round proved to be less fulfilling than making great beer, so with the encouragement of Lila, Linus quit his job, got a business degree from Vanderbilt and a craft-brewing education through a course at the American Brewer's Guild, and did an internship under Garrett Oliver at Brooklyn Brewery. Linus found a used 10 bbl brewing system from a brewpub in Iowa that had gone out of business, and went to work restoring a corner of the old Marathon Motorworks building for their brewery.

That means Euopean styles, but with a slight Southern interpretation.\r\nThanks to Free the Hops and the change in Alabama's formerly restrictive beer laws, creativity in brewing has come to Alabama.\r\n\r\nAt Yellowhammer, head brewer Keith Yager draws inspiration from both Belgian and German brewing traditions. An accomplished home brewer since 1995, Yager has designed numerous seasonal and specialty batches, from the Dark Hammer Belgian Quad to the UberAlt sticke ale. Other recurring ales are more experimental, blending styles, as with Tobacco Road, an imperial amber designed to complement a good cigar, or the occasional Lonesome Hop series, which spotlights the character of an individual hop. Yellowhammer is Yager's first commercial undertaking.\r\n\r\nYellowhammer Brewing opened on Oct. 16, 2010 with the best-selling Belgian white ale and the IPA. Other staples sold throughout the year include a German style altbier and the Miracle Worker, a potent Belgian tripel.","website":"http:\/\/www.yellowhammerbrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_h0FCyk-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_h0FCyk-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_h0FCyk-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2012-10-22 13:21:58","id":"4V6C7Y","streetAddress":"2406 Clinton Avenue","locality":"West Huntsville","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35805","phone":"256-975-5950","website":"http:\/\/www.yellowhammerbrewery.com\/","latitude":34.722525,"longitude":-86.603703,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"GHIewF","name":"Yellowhead Brewery","website":"http:\/\/www.yellowheadbrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-22 13:24:38","updateDate":"2012-10-22 13:25:24","id":"VXOGKd","streetAddress":"10229 105 St NW","locality":"Edmonton","region":"Alberta","postalCode":"T5J 3L5","phone":"780-423-3333","website":"http:\/\/www.yellowheadbrewery.com\/","latitude":53.543531,"longitude":-113.501064,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"KH","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-22 13:25:20","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Cambodia","isoThree":"KHM","numberCode":116,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"4AaNXK","name":"Yellowstone Valley Brewing Co.","description":"The Yellowstone Valley Brewery is located near the historic downtown district of Billings, Montana.

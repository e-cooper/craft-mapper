With a focus on premium quality, handmade Ales and Lagers, FDBC will present a new unique product to the Detroit area.\r\n\r\nMade in Michigan and the U.S.A.\r\n\r\nOne of the missions of FDBC is to create jobs and spur the economy in Michigan and the U.S. in general. At opening we plan to have 18 positions available with that number doubling year to year. Our long term goal is a bottling factory and additional restaurants that will employee hundreds of local workers.\r\n\r\nKeeping with our philosophy of locally sourced goods and services, we will purchase from local companies whenever possible. On the food side this includes local fish markets, meat markets and bakeries; and on the brewery side designing beers that will be made using Michigan grown hops and malt. And it doesn\u2019t stop there! We are actively negotiating and designing the brew house, promotional materials, general construction and website operations with Michigan companies.\r\n\r\nWhere it is not possible to source a product or service locally or in the State of Michigan, we will be looking first to keep our business in the Mid-West and then United States. We call this an inside-out sourcing philosophy. First source at the city level and slowly work out by county, state, region and country. We feel this benefits everyone in this endeavor where we support the community that is supporting us. A Win-Win for everyone!\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s All About the Beer!\r\n\r\nWe are going to be creating quality; handcrafted beers that we believe will be some of the best beer you have ever tried. We are also going to push the envelope and make beers with unique and far-out ingredients that will invite you to be different and maybe live a little on the edge.

In our tough conditions, these varieties produce intense, concentrated flavors and aromas not typical in their home regions.\r\nOur own ciders, at 6.5-7.5% alcohol, tend toward the dry, sharp, fruity and bountifully aromatic. We intend them to gladden the moment and to freshen the flavors of companionable foods. We are proud of Farnum Hill Ciders, and we are authoritatively told that, for now at least, they are the best-made ciders in America.\r\nLet's hope many more Eastern apple-growers will learn the craft and horticulture of cidermaking, and that distinctive American orchard-based ciders, now too rare, will return to their pre-Prohibition glory and variety.

Both Wayne and Mark were avid homebrewers for many years. Mark continued on with his brewing education by completing the Web-based Concise Course in Brewing Technology at the Siebel Institute of Technology World Brewing Acadamy from which he obtained his Certificate.   We selected our location nestled in the heart of the beautiful Finger Lakes Region of upstate New York for its close proximity to Keuka Lake and the availability for lake water for brewing. Our building offered a spacious workable layout, ample parking and room for future expansion. We began our building renovations and equipment installation in early 2010,  received our license in the fall of 2010, and on November 11th, 2010 opened our doors for tours, tastings, and growler fills. \r\n\r\nOur Brew Room features a matched Ripley 7 Barrel Stainless Steel Brewing system. The Brew House includes a Boil Kettle, Mash Tun and Hot Liquor Tank. The Brew Room also features 3 double wall digital temperature controlled fermentation tanks, grain mill, filter, and other assorted brewing equipment. Adjacent to the brew room is a walk-in cooler containing 8 - 7 Barrel Stainless Steel Serving Tanks and assorted keg filling and dispensing equipment. \r\n\r\nThe entrance way and tasting room offer large windows for great views of the Brew Room  as well as a large comfortable area for you and your friends to relax and visit while enjoying your favorite brews offered fresh daily. We offer tastings and growler fills of fine crafted ales and root beer all brewed on premises as well as guided tours on non-brewing days. Have your own growlers, we fill your clean growlers. Don't own one yet, no worries we have 1 and 2 liter in several styles with our logo on them.","website":"http:\/\/www.fingerlakesbeercompany.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2013-01-03 12:01:32","id":"kKNkdr","streetAddress":"8462 St Rt 54","locality":"Hammondsport","region":"New York","postalCode":"14840","phone":"607-569-3311","website":"http:\/\/www.fingerlakesbeercompany.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday 12:00 - 5:00                                         Monday 12:00-6:00                                    Tuesday       CLOSED                                  Wednesday 12:00-6:00                                       Thursday 12:00-6:00                                            Friday 12:00-6:00                                             Saturday 12:00-6:00","latitude":42.400165,"longitude":-77.224988,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"3bVrZD","name":"Finkel & Garf Brewing Co.","description":"Brewing high quality craft beer in Boulder, CO.

After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth's distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple's travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company's brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you're sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking. Whether you enjoy Flat Earth beers at home or out with friends, there are no secrets when it comes to good beer.","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_6IWGQA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_6IWGQA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_6IWGQA-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-05-23 13:43:05","id":"6gpvgZ","streetAddress":"2035 Benson Avenue","locality":"St. Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55116","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.9084187,"longitude":-93.1538067,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"LNr16q","name":"Hamm's Building","streetAddress":"688 Minnehaha Avenue East","locality":"Saint Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55106","phone":"(651) 698-1945","website":"http:\/\/www.flatearthbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sat: 12:00 pm - 6:30 pm","latitude":44.9629992,"longitude":-93.0716823,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-23 13:42:34","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"kxjm18","name":"Flat Rock Brew Cafe","description":"We are very proud of what the Flat Rock Brew Cafe stands for, and with our dedicated and friendly staff, look forward to seeing all our friends, locals and appreciators of beer, wine and cider!\r\n \r\nBeer is certainly our focus and our aim is for customers to walk out of the cafe more enlightened about this great beverage, than when they came in.

A long tradition that all the German brewers still obey to: In 1165 the first fine for serving bad beer was imposed in Augsburg. From 1487 onwards every brewer in Munich had to confirm on an oath to the ducal Rentmeister of Upper Bavaria, stating that he would not use any ingredients but barley, hops, and water to brew beer. Originally, this oath was valid in Munich only. In 1987 it was renewed by the Munich brewers.","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingbisonbrewing.com\/","established":"2000","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7SY01j\/upload_YIbCah-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7SY01j\/upload_YIbCah-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7SY01j\/upload_YIbCah-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:06","id":"c67gGy","streetAddress":"491 Ontario Street","locality":"Buffalo","region":"New York","postalCode":"14207","phone":"716-873-1557","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingbisonbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.956141,"longitude":-78.896576,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2000","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"jmGoBA","name":"Flying Dog Brewery","description":"The Flying Dog Legend begins in 1983, and like every good legend there are several versions of this tale. The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an \u201camateur mountaineering expedition\u201d to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, \u201cit is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogales.com\/","established":"1983","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_0z9L4W-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_0z9L4W-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_0z9L4W-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-11 23:24:34","id":"EPqUQP","streetAddress":"4607 Wedgewood Blvd","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21703","phone":"301-694-7899","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogales.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).","latitude":39.361926,"longitude":-77.424677,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1983","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"M5zcKb","name":"Flying Fish Brewing Company","description":"When Gene Muller founded Flying Fish Brewing Co. in 1995, he did so first on the World Wide Web - making it the world's first virtual microbrewery. That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site \u201cThis Old House meets the World Wide Web\u201d\u2014letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.\r\n\r\nHe also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order).\r\n\r\nFlying Fish Brewing Company is located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century. From its opening in late 1996, Flying Fish has tripled its capacity and become the largest of the approximately 20 craft breweries in the state.","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingfish.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_5NqI1c-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_5NqI1c-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_5NqI1c-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-09-11 19:57:34","id":"qjZIZq","streetAddress":"900 Kennedy Boulevard","locality":"Somerdale","region":"New Jersey","postalCode":"08083","phone":"856-504-3442","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingfish.com\/","latitude":39.853834,"longitude":-75.019803,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"DSCtzx","name":"Flying Goose Brewpub","description":"The Flying Goose Brew Pub & Grille is a family run restaurant that carries over 15 handcrafted brews on tap as well as an extensive menu offering many options to satisfy the whole family!\r\n\r\nWe strive to provide the best service and most enjoyable experience for any occasion; whether it be a quick lunch, a refreshing beer, or a nice dinner... we are ready to serve up just what you've been craving.","website":"http:\/\/www.flyinggoose.com\/","established":"1993","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DSCtzx\/upload_thIlu2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DSCtzx\/upload_thIlu2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DSCtzx\/upload_thIlu2-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2013-12-20 18:49:23","id":"T3I6jH","streetAddress":"40 Andover Road","locality":"New London","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03257","phone":"603-526-6899","website":"http:\/\/www.flyinggoose.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sat: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:30 am - 8:00 pm","latitude":43.3995653,"longitude":-71.9603467,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1993","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:23:20","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"FOfttK","name":"Flying Monkeys Craft Brewery","description":"The Flying Monkeys Craft Brewery is locally run by a few beer-lovin\u2019 friends and a family of unwavering Beer Disciples right in the heart of downtown Barrie, Ontario.

In 1924 the Fort George Building was erected to house an automotive repair facility until the late 1990's. Briefly abandoned and sadly neglected, the Fort George building has been recently revitalized as a home to the Blue Schorcher Bakery and our brewpub.

With a focus on the revival of artisan brewing, we strive to create the highest quality products available.\r\n\r\nBrewing techniques as timeless as beer itself are used to create a uniquely handmade product. We craft the finest possible beer in small batches normally not found in the industry today which is typically dominated by mega mergers of international breweries. Is this difficult and more time consuming? Yes. Does it require more manual labor? Yes. Is it worth it? Unequivocally, YES. As beer is a \u201cliving, breathing\u201d product made from precise strains of active yeast cultures, it just makes good sense to nurture the product in very manageable small batches. We believe that the extra care and attention devoted to each batch produces the best possible result and you as our friends deserve no less.\r\n\r\nWe hope that you will have the opportunity to experience the limited quantities of hand crafted beer that we produce in Charlotte. When you do, please notice the complexities of the aroma, the silkiness of its body, and the explosion of flavors as the grains merge artfully with the yeast cultures and noble hops blended meticulously for each variety. Join us in celebrating the pleasures of hand crafted beers and life in the Queen City finally merged into this moment in time and allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying a uniquely Charlotte experience.","website":"http:\/\/fourfriendsbrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hcCgPK\/upload_XaEKBW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hcCgPK\/upload_XaEKBW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hcCgPK\/upload_XaEKBW-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:11","id":"amIfT7","streetAddress":"10913 C Office Park Drive","locality":"Charlotte","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28273","website":"http:\/\/fourfriendsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Saturday: 3pm - 7pm","latitude":35.12048,"longitude":-80.9595499,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","yearClosed":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"NMTPY6","name":"Four Horsemen Brewing Company","description":"Micro-Brewery producing handcrafted Ales and Lagers.

Since then, he has been dedicated to perfecting both his craft and the quality of his beers. Now armed with an arsenal of hand-crafted recipes, he and his two partners, Andy Kerkhoff and Ashby Armistead, have decided to venture into the commercial arena and turn the dream that began in 2002 into a reality.

The cidery originally sat in the historic Fruit Growers Exchange Association, a building that once was a storage and packing facility for the abundance of fruits grown in the area. It seemed appropriate to use this space, bringing it back towards its original use.

William, pictured here with his mother, went on to marry Priscilla Needham in 1899 and became Chairman of Frederic Robinson Limited in 1920.\r\nFast forward to the early decades of the 20th century and Frederic\u2019s grandchildren, sons of William, joined the family business. After Frederic\u2019s passing, his widow Emma owned the business in entirety and it was shortly prior to her death that she instigated the formation of Frederic Robinson Limited. 4th generation Robinsons, Frederic, John and Cecil joined the board and continued to build the company alongside their father William.\r\n\r\nWith bottling commencing from a new building in 1908, new offices in 1913 and a new brewhouse in 1929, by William\u2019s death in 1933, despite the countries difficult economic climate, Robinsons was strongly positioned for further growth. Over the following years, the estate grew by acquisition, new buildings and extending the geographical area. The first Welsh house \u2013 The Black Lion was bought in 1943. William Robinson, would have been proud to hear John, his great grandchild, was honoured with a knighthood in 1958 for political and public services in Cheshire- 120 years after William purchased the Unicorn Inn. The early 1950\u2019s saw 5th generation Robinsons, Peter, Dennis and David, starting to join the business.\r\n\r\nOver the past 6 decades Robinsons has continued to grow. 15th October 1975 saw the first bottling at a newly built packaging centre in Bredbury- ongoing development at UPC (Unicorn Packaging Centre) means all our beers are now transferred from Unicorn Brewery to Bredbury for packaging and distribution once fermentation is complete. Robinsons\u2019 bottled ales such as Old Tom and Unicorn are distributed worldwide. The sixth generation strive to build further upon the family legacy. Neil, Veronica, Paul, Oliver and William were elected to the board in September 2003, followed three years later by Sara, who is now Company Secretary and John in May 2009.\r\n\r\nOur eyes are firmly on the future as we develop brewery, brands and pubs at pace. With over \u00a35 million investment in a new Brew House (including the World\u2019s largest hopnik, which strains hops to maximise aroma and flavour), Training Centre for excellence and Visitors Centre, there is much to look forward to.","website":"http:\/\/www.robinsonsbrewery.com\/","established":"1838","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OEO8JG\/upload_fMmg81-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OEO8JG\/upload_fMmg81-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OEO8JG\/upload_fMmg81-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-06-17 12:09:27","id":"lxWkzT","streetAddress":"Unicorn Brewery","locality":"Stockport","region":"Cheshire","postalCode":"SK11JJ","phone":"44-(0161)-480-6571","website":"http:\/\/www.robinsonsbrewery.com\/","latitude":53.4101496,"longitude":-2.1551029,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","yearOpened":"1838","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"0Y6wSh","name":"Frederick Brewing","description":"Facilities of Frederick Brewing company were bought out by Flying Dog","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:06","id":"OHFZ8u","streetAddress":"4607 Wedgewood Boulevard","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"20176","phone":"1-888-258-7434","latitude":39.362696,"longitude":-77.426454,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"eTJ9AZ","name":"Fredericksburg Brewing Company","description":"We began our operation in 1994, within months of the passage of legislation allowing brewpub operation in the state of Texas.

Now one of the leading brewery\u2019s in this sector, Freedom\u2019s range of beers have won over 25 International and National awards in the last 4 years alone.\r\n\r\nAll Freedom Beer is bottom fermented in closed, pressurized vessels. Lager is fermented at a lower temperature than ale and therefore takes longer \u2013 between 7 to 14 days, in contrast to 4 to 5 days. During fermentation, the beer naturally carbonates itself as a result of the breakdown of sugars to alcohol.\r\n\r\nAfter the fermentation stage, the \u2018young\u2019 beer is transferred to maturation or storage tanks, where it\u2019s stored at -1 \u030aC. Freedom Brewery has a minimum maturation period of 4 weeks; this improves both the beer\u2019s flavour profiles and naturally increases its stability, removing the need for chemical intervention. The verb \u2018Lagerun\u2019 is German for \u2018to store\u2019 \u2013 ironic as the majority of mass produced \u2018lagers\u2019 are brewed within days, with little or no maturation time at all.\r\n\r\nFreedom Brewery sterile triple filters its beers to remove any remaining yeast and protein cells. This is instead of pasteurisation which, whilst being a cheaper process, carries the risk of ruining the beer\u2019s natural flavours. Freedom\u2019s first sterile filtration uses diatomaceous earth in contrast to isinglass, which is a substance obtained from the swim bladders of fish. As a result, all Freedom Beers are certified by the Vegan Society.","website":"http:\/\/www.freedombrewery.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zgCDhX\/upload_0hOLyo-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zgCDhX\/upload_0hOLyo-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zgCDhX\/upload_0hOLyo-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2013-08-12 22:23:31","id":"FEPzbD","streetAddress":"5430 Shiloh Forest Dr","locality":"Midlothian","region":"Texas","postalCode":"76065","phone":"321-745-9819","website":"http:\/\/www.freedombeer.com\/","latitude":32.517917,"longitude":-96.923991,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"XWih3e","streetAddress":"Bagots Park","locality":"Abbots Bromley","region":"Staffordshire","postalCode":"WS15 3ER","phone":"+44 (0) 1283 840 721","latitude":52.8366558,"longitude":-1.8697278,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 22:25:23","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"FSj9lR","name":"Freedom's Edge Brewing","description":"Stop in and enjoy one of our hand crafted beers.

Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.\r\n \r\nSaisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks\u2019 two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm.

The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida.

The reason for so lofty a goal was of course to cheaply serve the more important purpose of the business--getting beer to the beer drinker, putting bottles on the shelf. However, even \u201ccheap\u201d was expensive to us. Pinching pennies and moving cautiously wasn\u2019t helping us reach our self imposed deadline of Summer of 2006. Then we met the good folks at Sand Creek Brewing Co (Black River Falls, WI) who agreed to bring us on as customers, allowing us to use their facility to get the beer brewed. We were thus able to skip the hard lessons of construction pitfalls and went straight to filling stainless steel tanks with beer. \r\n\r\nThe scrape-together building and used equipment model was then blacked out from the \u201cPhase 1\u201d section of the business plan. Aran went on the road to be hands on at Sand Creek; Chris went on the road to sell beer. We have since acquired another property in Spring Green (known affectionately as the Shitty Barn), and we have often been heard threatening to build a brewery on this site, sometimes quite convincingly. But \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d seems to be the winning adage. So until we break it, we won\u2019t likely fix our present model. \r\n\r\nSo that is the back story--the mental seasoning for your next sip of Furthermore Beer. Fair warning to the newcomer: those who like our beers always seem to find at least one to stick in the \u201chate\u201d column\u2014ant that\u2019s always one that someone else places in the \u201clove\u201d column with a glittery heart sticker next to it. So remember, if you have distaste for one of our beers, it could our failings, or it could be your poor upbringing and resulting prejudices--so hate with an open mind.","website":"http:\/\/www.furthermorebeer.com\/","established":"2005","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.furthermorebeer.com\/mailing-list","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_dFOuLs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_dFOuLs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_dFOuLs-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2012-05-30 12:33:14","id":"SY2b6E","streetAddress":"525 East Madison Street","extendedAddress":"PO Box 776","locality":"Spring Green","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53588","phone":"608-588-3300","website":"http:\/\/www.furthermorebeer.com\/","latitude":43.18111,"longitude":-90.072391,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"yMNCtg","name":"G Brewing Co","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:16","id":"4rlPFf","streetAddress":"61421 Navajo Trail","locality":"Joshua Tree","region":"California","postalCode":"92252","phone":"760-366-3015","latitude":34.112118,"longitude":-116.324031,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"DoOKNM","name":"G'ale Warnings Brewery","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:17","id":"hBUDP6","streetAddress":"2358 W Hwy 101","extendedAddress":"#3","locality":"Port Angeles","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98363","latitude":48.102175,"longitude":-123.500363,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"BjL1z3","name":"G.

Driven by a desire for a quality, local product that would complement and diversify the already existing pub's style and reputation, Larry and Peter knew they would have to focus on producing a high quality product if it was going to be a success.  Knowing his beer knowledge and passion for the family business in which he grew up, Larry and Peter soon brought Larry's son Andrew into the conversation.  Beginning in a consulting roll, Andrew soon decided it was time to come back into the fold and asked his father and uncle for an opportunity to rejoin the family business in a full-time position.  In the coming year as business at the pub rolled on and continued to grow, so too did the brewery project.  Moving from an idea spoken about \u201coff the clock\u201d to a plan developed in a weekly owner's meeting, Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company began to take shape.  The project received a major boost in the most unlikely of circumstances when Larry, attending a local funeral, made contact with Sarah Courtney, a woman who grew up with Larry's oldest son Thomas.  Sarah and her husband Jason had spent the past 15 years working full-time in brewpub and microbrewery settings.  Jason had progressed from homebrewer to assistant brewer to head brewer and in 2002 had a very successful showing at the Great American Beer Festival, receiving the brewpub category brewmaster of the year honors.  As Larry, Peter and Andrew continued conversations and expressed their desire to build a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Jason and Sarah also expressed their interest in moving back to the Bangor area.  In time, with many conversations and meetings, both desires began to take shape.  With many options available to them, Jason and Sarah decided an opportunity to have a foundational and long-term impact on and relationship with a truly local brewery in Bangor, Maine was exactly what they were looking for.  In December 2011 the idea became a reality.  The Geaghan Family, together with award winning brewer Jason Courtney, have begun pouring pints of locally craft brewed beer from Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company exclusively at Geaghan's Pub.","website":"http:\/\/www.geaghanspub.com","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_lnNlJi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_lnNlJi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_lnNlJi-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 18:56:21","updateDate":"2013-05-10 19:13:03","id":"oN5ry0","streetAddress":"570 Main Street","locality":"Bangor","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04401","phone":"207-945-3730","website":"http:\/\/www.geaghanspub.com","latitude":44.786998,"longitude":-68.777343,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 19:02:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"DaJPkB","name":"Geaux Brewing","description":"Geaux started in a garage\u2026like most startups\u2014in the summer of 2011. Except, it wasn't a garage in someone's house but rather in Jeremy's business. With concrete floors and roll up doors, it was the perfect place to brew beer\u2014and no spouses would be ticked that their kitchen or home was getting trashed in the process. The reason for wanting to \"home\" brew? Because the Friday beer parties at his business were starting to rack up some serious expenses. After all, we wanted to drink the good stuff and 22oz. bombers ain't cheap. So, Jeremy got the crazy idea (as he often does) to figure out a way to make beer so that we didn't have to spend so much money on other people's beer. \r\n\r\nThe problem was\u2026where to start? Jeremy knew he wanted to brew beer but the reality was that with so many home brewers out there\u2014each with their own opinion on how to do things\u2014it was going to be a challenge to corral and sift through the information he needed to get started and actually brew good beer. \r\n\r\nAfter a few \"test\" batches that yielded sub-standard beer, he got serious and started researching and researching and doing even more research until that first \"golden\" batch came through. Eventually, the challenge went from brewing good beer to brewing good beer consistently. Again, with more research, he figured it out. Then, he got the idea. \"What about other new or rookie home brewers out there? Aren't they facing the same problems I am? Wouldn't they and new home brewers want a convenient location to get it hands-on information about brewing?\" At that moment, Geaux went from a hobby to a serious endeavor to bring professional-level brewing techniques to the home brewing community. Then, the REAL fun began.\r\n\r\nGoing from a \"home\" brewing operation to a commercial brewery (which is required if you plan to brew anywhere outside of home\u2026even if you don't sell it (oops.)) was a bit more than anyone ever envisioned. After a year of plodding away at paperwork, construction, and using up every ounce of goodwill from family and friends, the Geaux brewery and tap room opened up to the public on October 19th, 2013.","website":"http:\/\/geauxbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DaJPkB\/upload_xfHLsD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DaJPkB\/upload_xfHLsD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DaJPkB\/upload_xfHLsD-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-23 02:31:32","updateDate":"2014-09-24 20:44:55","id":"rqVDmz","streetAddress":"12031 Northup Way","extendedAddress":"Suite 203","locality":"Bellevue","region":"WA","postalCode":"98005","phone":"425-505-8765","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\nTue:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\nThu:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\nFri:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\nSun:  1:00pm - 6:00pm\n\nLast call 15 min prior to close.\r\nCheck our calendar for food truck schedules & special events!","latitude":47.6304115,"longitude":-122.1797945,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-01 14:27:53","updateDate":"2014-10-01 14:27:53","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"k3vBvk","name":"Gella's Diner & Lb.

Gaining positive feedback through local beer festivals and finding many comrades in the local brewing community, Zac and Cari sought to open a microbrewery, giving Zac a better excuse to indulge in his obsession.\r\n\r\nEstablished in 2011, Gnarly Barley Brewing is located in a 10,500 square foot facility in Hammond, Louisiana and consists of a two-vessel 30bbl Brewhouse, one hot and one cold liquor tank, four fermentation vessels, one bright beer tank and a whole lot of passion for craft beer.","website":"http:\/\/gnarlybeer.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vIikZV\/upload_FgB4gF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vIikZV\/upload_FgB4gF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vIikZV\/upload_FgB4gF-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-28 18:13:38","updateDate":"2014-10-29 14:39:44","id":"zNaGRX","streetAddress":"1709 Corbin Road","locality":"Hammond","region":"LA","postalCode":"70403","phone":"985-318-0723","latitude":30.4972751,"longitude":-90.4785871,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-29 14:33:42","updateDate":"2014-10-29 14:33:42","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"lrK6ZT","name":"Goat Head Brewing","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:16","id":"KJmWjL","locality":"Rio Rancho","region":"New Mexico","latitude":35.24159,"longitude":-106.660029,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"pHOEo6","name":"GoatHouse Brewing Co.","description":"Enjoy the taste of handcrafted ales made onsite in our converted barn.

A labor of love in which long brew days in the garage, bad equipment, curious dogs (we still blame them for a bad batch or two) and hanging out with friends became commonplace. Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).\r\n\r\nWe took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It\u2019s pretty fun to have someone you don\u2019t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn\u2019t set out to start a business, the business just found us. \r\n\r\n\u201cOnce in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right\u201d Robert Hunter\r\n\r\nWe wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners. \r\n\r\nGood People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company\u2026.to be good people. \r\n\r\nIn September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery.

The site was chosen by Grand Ridge for its exceptional water quality for beer making, given its position on the top of the mountains in the Strzelecki ranges. After extensive product testing to achieve the highest standards in pure beer, Grand Ridge commenced brewing in June 1989.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGrand Ridge is at the top of the list in high quality beers. All the beers are produced to exceptionally high standards of flavour and purity, with no added chemicals or preservatives.  This typically results in a far less severe hangover, if any at all.\r\n\r\nAt Grand Ridge the quality of the beer is never compromised. The mission at Grand Ridge is always to make the best beer in the world. Grand Ridge is a 100% Australian, family owned company.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the Grand Ridge beers has been recognized with over 160 Australian and International beer awards. In 2002 at the Australian and International beer Awards Grand Ridge won 29 medals. This was more than any other brewery in the world including all 19 countries represented.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 Grand Ridge won 21 medals including 6 best of class winners (double any other brewery in the world). In 2002, 2003 and 2005 Grand Ridge won Victoria's best beer for the Premiers Trophy along with 62 other international medals.

Come celebrate with us 110 years of beverage production and bottling onsite! \r\n\r\nHistory: in December 2012, Mastroeli-MacNeil Equity Investments financed the purchase of this 31,690 square foot configuration of two warehouses, situated on 2.08 acres contiguous to Downtown Granite Falls. A panoramic view of the Blue Ridge Mountains runs the rear of the building. The owners financed a painstaking build-out, and are proud of the adaptive reuse of this warehouse\/manufacturing space into a supper club, eatery, and old-style \"watering hole.\" \r\n\r\nThe Brewery: GFB is a 30BBL\/(40BBL) craft beer production facility. We brew onsite and within sight while you indulge your senses in our Southern Gastropub restaurant and attached Tasting Room. Our brewpub features a wraparound 103-foot-long tasting counter, copper\/penny-topped wine bar, and serves as a world-class music venue. Eclectic artifacts dress the spaces for those with an itch for the odd or unique.\r\n\r\nThe owners of Granite Falls Brewing Company invite you to visit our site, indulge in an experience that is In A Glass By Itself, partake of laughter, fellowship and community, lo and behold what we unearthed between the walls and specimens of the original Granite Bottling Works bottles.

Our shared love of food and beer propelled us to start an underground beer tasting movement during which we hosted a series of 7 beer tasting events over the course of a 13 months. We may be the new kids on the Prescott scene, but GMB brings ten years of brewing experience to the table. From the farmlands of Vermont to the mountains of Alaska; the homelands of Idaho and now the high deserts of Prescott! \r\n\r\nGMB opened the doors on the brewery and taproom in August 2012. By small operation, we mean SMALL. Not micro. We're talking about nanobrewing here, folks. We're a grassroots endeavor that began in a garage and garnered fast support from the community. \r\n\r\nWe pride ourselves on high-quality unpretentious beer. We like to brew traditional styles as well as creative twists on the traditional. Inspired by the local landscape and community, we look forward to experimenting with local ingredients (wheat berries, juniper berries, prickly pear fruit) and becoming part of the local flavor of Prescott. Beer education is part of what we do: styles, processes, ingredients, and the magical pairing between beer and food. Why? Because this is all part of celebrating the simpler things in life: good food, good friends, good beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.granitemountainbrewing.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/qtLQ7F\/upload_LWdiOR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/qtLQ7F\/upload_LWdiOR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/qtLQ7F\/upload_LWdiOR-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-02 18:20:13","updateDate":"2013-03-02 18:21:56","id":"wI1wn8","streetAddress":"123 N Cortez St","locality":"Prescott","region":"Arizona","postalCode":"86301","phone":"(928) 778-5535","website":"http:\/\/www.granitemountainbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed - Thu: 4:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSat: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm\r\nSun: 1:00 pm - 6:00 pm","latitude":34.5427831,"longitude":-112.4686784,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-02 18:21:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"oRcuap","name":"Granville Brewing Company","description":"The Granville Brewing Company is located in Granville, Ohio.

We've been making beer for many years now and wanted to share our love of beer with as many people as we could. With that in mind, we founded Great Storm Brewing in 2010, and opened our doors and our taps to the public in March 2012.\r\n\r\nOur name? Well, for us, there's a lot of anticipation in tasting a new beer. The way the foam settles in a glass of dark stout, or the raining effect you can see in a pint of IPA served on nitro... they remind us sometimes of the expectant feeling we get watching powerful storms roll in over the mountains in our home town of Colorado Springs. Yes, we tend to wax poetic over a pint glass. I told you we love beer. But anyway, that was part of the inspiration. The other part was our beloved half Husky, half Aussie brewdog, Storm. He's a little... wild. Like our beers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hope you'll find the same passion for drinking our beers as we do for making them. Come in and see us, we'll be pleased to pour you a pint.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe wax a little poetic about it.","website":"http:\/\/www.greatstormbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ersDcu\/upload_DaQVZL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ersDcu\/upload_DaQVZL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ersDcu\/upload_DaQVZL-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-21 15:15:20","updateDate":"2014-02-21 15:16:41","id":"Z5KemR","streetAddress":"204 Mount View Lane","extendedAddress":"#3","locality":"Colorado Springs","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80907","phone":"(719) 266-4200","website":"http:\/\/www.greatstormbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue - Thu: 1:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm","latitude":38.8900758,"longitude":-104.8179674,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-21 15:16:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"95h0NL","name":"Great Waters Brewing Company","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:06","id":"SrMadz","streetAddress":"426 St.Peter Street","locality":"Saint Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55102","phone":"1-651-224-2739","latitude":44.9467268,"longitude":-93.0970016,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"lPPoWm","name":"Green Bay Brewing","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:06","id":"5B5OnQ","streetAddress":"313 Dousman Street","locality":"Green Bay","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54303","phone":"1-888-604-2337","latitude":44.5191303,"longitude":-88.0196139,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"X8ret4","name":"Green Beacon Brewing Co","description":"Green Beacon Brewing Company is Teneriffe\u2019s first boutique craft brewery and ale works.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool\/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_999gvA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_999gvA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_999gvA-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2012-04-09 18:18:49","id":"AlhRYb","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 12-8\r\nFriday and Saturday: 12-10","latitude":41.8856286,"longitude":-86.5946671,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"EgJ38W","name":"Greene King","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:06","id":"n5QFi2","streetAddress":"Westgate Street","locality":"Bury St. Edmunds","region":"Suffolk","phone":"44-(01284)-763222","latitude":52.240955,"longitude":0.71297,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"2dAEr0","name":"Greenpoint Beer Works Inc","website":"http:\/\/www.kelsoofbrooklyn.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:17","id":"PP93rT","streetAddress":"529 Waverly Ave","locality":"Brooklyn","region":"New York","postalCode":"11238","website":"http:\/\/www.kelsoofbrooklyn.com\/","latitude":40.6823455,"longitude":-73.9655843,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"b15cO3","name":"Greenport Harbor Brewing Company","description":"The idea began a long time ago over \u2026 well \u2026 a pretty terrible beer.  You see we (John from NY and Rich from Boston) met in college and had to drink what beer we could afford in those days.\r\n\r\nAs the years went by, the better the beer we consumed, the more we were consumed by it.  We tried every beer imaginable.  We read about beer. We talked about beer. We began making our own beer.  And finally we started talking and dreaming about opening a brewery on the North Fork.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 2008 the dream became a reality when Rich heard about an old firehouse for sale in the Village of Greenport.  Driven by thirst more than brains, we bought the building in the middle of what has been called a Global Economic Meltdown.  Next we started the renovation.  Did we mention Global Economic Meltdown?  We tried to do most of the work ourselves and luckily got a lot of help from some good friends and family. \r\nThe promise of beer can be powerful. Our luck continued when on a snowy January day, with no roof on our brewery, we got a visit from DJ Swanson and his 2 young children. No one in their right mind would have joined us. DJ did and agreed to be our new head brewer. In April with roof replaced, windows installed, and drains dug, our brew house arrived and the idea of making Greenport Harbor beer began. Four months later in July of 2009 we were officially shipping (hand truck and family cars) our beer.\r\n\r\nToday our beer is served in over 200 places on Long Island (thank you Justin) and NYC.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re proud to say that since summer of 2009 we have been singled out for nearly every beer we have brewed from the Village Voice to the Tasting Table to TimeOut NY to Newsday to NY Examiner to Wall Street Journal to countless beer and food blogs.\r\nWe have a total of 13 employees if you include our forklift and delivery truck, which we do. We hope to add to this number in the next few months when we grow by 66 and 2\/3\u2019s percent by adding 2 new tanks. We are the only local brewery that brews 100% of our beer. We are small but hungry\u2026we mean thirsty.","website":"http:\/\/www.harborbrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/b15cO3\/upload_F15kbe-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/b15cO3\/upload_F15kbe-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/b15cO3\/upload_F15kbe-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2012-09-18 17:35:05","id":"1irs0u","streetAddress":"234 Carpenter Street","locality":"Greenport","region":"New York","postalCode":"11944","phone":"631-477-6681","website":"http:\/\/www.harborbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Open for Tastings\/Growlers\/Retail:\r\nFri & Sat 12-7pm\r\nSun 12-6pm","latitude":41.1024718,"longitude":-72.3589459,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"r01rHx","name":"Greenshields Brewery and Pub","website":"http:\/\/www.greenshields.com\/","established":"1989","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/r01rHx\/upload_SnpMTI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/r01rHx\/upload_SnpMTI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/r01rHx\/upload_SnpMTI-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2012-03-29 21:08:06","id":"e2agAL","streetAddress":"214 E.

The main product produced at the brewery is Guinness Draft.\r\n\r\nLeased for 9,000 years in 1759 by Arthur Guinness at \u00a345 per year, St. James's Gate has been the home of Guinness ever since. It became the largest brewery in Ireland in 1838, and was the largest in the world in 1914, covering 64 acres. Although no longer the largest brewery in the world, it is still the largest brewer of stout in the world. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the brewery owned most of the buildings in the surrounding area, including many streets of housing for brewery employees, and offices associated with the brewery. The brewery also made all of its own power using its own power plant.\r\n\r\nThere is an attached exhibition on the 250-year-old history of Guinness, called the Guinness Storehouse.","website":"http:\/\/www.guinness.com\/","established":"1759","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HaPdSL\/upload_5ar2S5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HaPdSL\/upload_5ar2S5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HaPdSL\/upload_5ar2S5-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-05-05 12:00:04","id":"9RsQkk","streetAddress":"109 James's Street","locality":"Dublin City","region":"Dublin","postalCode":"8","website":"http:\/\/www.guinness.com\/","latitude":53.34309,"longitude":-6.290799,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IE","yearOpened":"1759","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Ireland","isoThree":"IRL","numberCode":372,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"hnePju","name":"Guldenbacher Brauhaus Nahetal","website":"http:\/\/www.guldenbacher.de\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:19:37","updateDate":"2012-08-13 00:23:54","id":"eeksV9","streetAddress":"Riemenschneiderstr. 6","locality":"Windesheim","region":"Rhineland-Palatinate","postalCode":"55452","latitude":49.90738,"longitude":7.81624,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-13 00:24:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"bUfWDv","name":"Gulf Coast Brewing Co","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:17","id":"llbEuB","streetAddress":"5227 Lillian St","locality":"Houston","region":"Texas","postalCode":"77007","phone":"832-283-7186","latitude":29.769629,"longitude":-95.414601,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"YuMiCZ","name":"Gulpener Bierbrouwerij","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2012-03-21 19:06:06","id":"O5K33c","streetAddress":"Rijksweg 16","locality":"Gulpen","phone":"31-043-4507575","latitude":50.8143855,"longitude":5.8907433,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NL","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","displayName":"Netherlands","isoThree":"NLD","numberCode":528,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"WsP6Ax","name":"Gun Hill Brewing Company","description":"A new brewery located in the Bronx serving hand-crafted beers both on-site in our tasting room and at bars\/restaurants throughout the NY Metropolitan area.","website":"http:\/\/gunhillbrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WsP6Ax\/upload_fwC9J0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WsP6Ax\/upload_fwC9J0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WsP6Ax\/upload_fwC9J0-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-25 14:23:50","updateDate":"2014-07-25 18:45:05","id":"2b0qJ7","streetAddress":"3227 Laconia Ave","locality":"Bronx","region":"New York","postalCode":"10469","phone":"(718) 881-0010","website":"http:\/\/gunhillbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  1:00pm -

Up until then the beer was only being sold in kegs. Between 1968 and 1990 they've been expanding by taking over breweries in the south of the Netherlands and North of France. In the 1990's they've started modernising the brewery. In 2010 this modernisation process was completed when they inaugurated their new kegigng hall.

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_6ztnSI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_6ztnSI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_6ztnSI-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2014-07-11 23:35:46","id":"AGRvvY","streetAddress":"336 Ruth Carney Drive","locality":"Windsor","region":"Vermont","postalCode":"05089","phone":"802-674-5491","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.5130201,"longitude":-72.4016913,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2014-10-06 15:45:55","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"9aSjFg","name":"Boston","streetAddress":"306 Northern Avenue","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02210","phone":"1-888-HARPOON","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com","latitude":42.3465,"longitude":-71.033843,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-26 14:01:43","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},{"id":"CiARRy","name":"Harriet Brewing","description":"At Harriet Brewing we emphasize intention as the primary component in recipe development.

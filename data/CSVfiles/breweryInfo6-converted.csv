Due to the growing success and demand for Harviestoun Ales, the brewery moved to a new purpose built 60 barrel plant, 5 miles away in Alva, in 2004. Alva was chosen as the location as this allowed us to carry on using the outstanding soft water from the Ochil Hills.    Harviestoun Brewery was later bought by Caledonian Brewery in 2006. However, in the wake of the acquisition of Caledonian brewing Company by Scottish & Newcastle UK, the brewery became independent once again in 2008 by three noble shareholders who sought to preserve the status as an independent award-winning micro-brewery.     Currently, Harviestoun is going through some new and exciting changes to expand the brewery. We are working hard to increase production, while insuring that we still outputting nothing but quality beer.

The founder and driving force of High Point is award-winning homebrewer, Greg Zaccardi. After working as a brewer in southern Germany, Greg returned to the US to open his brewery.    Ramstein beers are made with the same care and precision that Greg learned in Germany. In fact, the wheat, barley, hops and yeast used to make Ramstein Beers are all imported directly from Bavaria.    Greg found a special brewer’s yeast used only by a small brewery in Bavaria. He was able to get the brewery to let him use the special yeast exclusively at High Point. The unique, complex character of Ramstein beers is a result of this private yeast and of course, High Point’s careful and proper brewing methods.    The name Ramstein was adopted from a town in Germany with a large American population. The town surrounds the U.S. Ramstein Air Force Base. High Point wanted the name of its beers to reflect a marriage of German tradition and American innovation.    Today High Point Brewing Company expanded beyond wheat beers and brews 11 different wheat beers and lagers.","","1996","","","","Gift Shop & Tasting Room Hours:   M-F 9am - 6:30pm   Sat 1pm - 4pm","","1996","","",""

It is one of Munich's oldest beer halls. It was originally founded as the brewery to the old Royal Residence, which at that time was situated just around the corner from where the beer hall stands today. The beer quickly became world famous thanks to the first brewer, Heimeran Pongratz, and the famous ""Bavarian Beer Purity Law"" of 1516 that stated that only natural ingredients could be used in the brewing process. In fact, the beer became so famous that it once saved the city from annihilation. When King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden invaded Bavaria during the Thirty Years' War in 1632, he threatened to sack and burn the entire city of Munich. He agreed to leave the city in peace if the citizens surrendered some hostages, and 600,000 barrels of Hofbräuhaus beer.","276","1589","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4rlPFf/upload_4Q1DyU-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4rlPFf/upload_4Q1DyU-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4rlPFf/upload_4Q1DyU-large.png","Daily 9:00am - 11:30pm","","","","",""

In addition to the attention to detail required for consistent and repeatable brews the brewmaster and support personnel follow a disciplined regiment of cleaning manually, and automatically with Clean-In-Place Systems (CIP) to exclude off-flavors, contaminants, and other undesirables in our beers.

While your ""good"" nature will definitely be aroused by this cool, spirit-raising refreshment, your inner evil will soon begin to feel less inhibited, allowing initial laughter and fun to soon require an internal battle of self-restraint.    History - Since the dawn of mankind, we have struggled with the battle of good and evil. To drown in guilt or sorrow is unhealthy and seen by some as wasted emotions. In opposition, to live our lives completely without impure influence and to be seen by all as “up-tight” without the ability to cut loose on occasion is viewed in equally a negative fashion. Until now, there has never been a respectable or enjoyable solution to this life long struggle.  HolyBrew is a positive channel for cleansing one’s mind, body and spirit of unwanted or unnecessary guilt, doubt or unhappiness. Through a recently discovered magical formula, believed to be created from the gods themselves, HolyBrew has formulated the “Liquid Confession”. What better way to cleanse one’s soul than to partake of this succulent brew, confess one’s sins and erroneous ways and let the weight of their guilt be lifted and their thirst quenched simultaneously.  Join the movement in guilt-free pleasure and refreshment. Have your liquid confession today and enjoy life to its fullest.","","2008","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/OpMVbb/upload_GjomQO-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/OpMVbb/upload_GjomQO-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/OpMVbb/upload_GjomQO-large.png","","","2008","","",""

Don had five years experience in home-brewing and worked at the Thomas Kemper Brewery before its closing. When Kemper's closed its doors, he decided to follow his passion and strike out on his own.     Distribution of Hood Canal Beers started in Kitsap County. He later expanded his sales to the Seattle area via Odom Distributing Corporation, and now he personally distributes to bars, pubs, and grocery stores in Kitsap and surrounding counties.     Our Tasting Room is on Bond Road between Kingston and Poulsbo. It's about the ten minute drive from the Kingston ferry terminal or from Poulsbo.","","1996","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Yr1UcD/upload_HbYfTN-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Yr1UcD/upload_HbYfTN-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Yr1UcD/upload_HbYfTN-large.png","Wed - Thu: 2:00 pm - 8:00 pm  Fri - Sat: 12:00 pm - 8:00 pm  Sun: 12:00 pm - 7:00 pm","","","","",""

Weissbeer is classic Belgian and German beer tradition dating back to ancient times. And the right person to introduce the German weissbier tradition of Indslev Bryggeri is Brewmaster Stefan Peter Stadler.

Stefan Peter Stadler was born and raised in Munich, where he is graduated master brewer at Hofbrauhaus in Munich. He has experience in both German and Danish breweries.    Discover our interpretation of Danish Weissbier that is hand-brewed by Bavarian tradition. We believe that hand-brewed beer tastes better. The entire brewing process is controlled by hand, and we treat for all the details and the best ingredients.

Established in 2003, its beer has gone on to be the most popular British bottled beer sold in Canada, and second most popular in Sweden. It was part of the nominated drinks list for the G8 Summit 2005 at Gleneagles Hotel.    The business is, since 2008, family owned following a management buy-out from its original part-owners, William Grant and Sons.    Their Innis & Gunn Original beer is brewed in Dunbar, East Lothian before being matured in American white oak Bourbon barrels for 30 days and is then a further 47 days in a marrying tun, and so it is matured for 77 days in total. It is 6.6% alcohol by volume. At first only available as a bottled beer it is now marketed both in bottles and as draught.    According to Innis and Gunn's website, the process was discovered in an ironic accident: the intent was to create a scotch whisky with ale flavours. To do this, a special beer was created which would then be stored in the whisky barrels. After the beer had conditioned the barrels, it was to be discarded and replaced with the whisky. The brewers noted that the process had an agreeable effect on the beer, and thus aging the beer became an end in itself.    A ""blonde"" version of Innis & Gunn is also widely available, and a limited edition matured in rum barrels was produced.","826","2003","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_attxYK-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_attxYK-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jC0TAa/upload_attxYK-large.png","","","","","",""

It had a very mom and pop feel, and featured a look that was as traditional as it gets. Those who knew of it visited regularly, but the regulars were few. For many, the brewery was a thing shrouded in mystery... college students-which comprise a fair percentage of Ellensburg's population for most of the year-would occasionally see a bottle on a store shelf and ask where it came from. The likely response:    ""Yeah, I think some dude makes that in his basement or something...""    The word just wasn't getting out, and things didn't look good for the tiny brewery that made exceptionally tasty ales.   Well, a couple of hoodlums in their late-twenties jumped on the opportunity to own and operate their own brewery, and what resulted is the Iron Horse Brewery you know and love today. They tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good things started to happen. Locals started to dig what the guys were doing. A few bars took a chance and put Iron Horse back on tap, and the beer started flowing.     The word started getting out.","","2004","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ni4EnY/upload_eun7Ba-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ni4EnY/upload_eun7Ba-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ni4EnY/upload_eun7Ba-large.png","","Suite 4","2004","","",""

Soon he found himself president and heading up the Marin County State Fair competitions, and after burning out all the burners on the stove, he was banished to brewing outdoors. A certified beer judge, he worked at Marin Brewing Company before starting off on his own, moving south to Carpinteria. Now a family run brewery, Island Brewing Company has won awards on both the state and national level. We serve local bars, restaurants, and retail outlets and have five and fifteen-gallon kegs and 22-ounce bottles available for weddings, caterers, as well as for thirsty individuals that happen to come our way.

I had always liked my beer, but I realized that there tends to be a brewer’s bias towards their own beer.  A great deal of time and effort goes into making a batch of beer, so the brewer is bound to speak highly of their own goods.  It turns out, I’m my own worst critic.  I’m constantly searching for ways to improve the beer.  Whenever I shared brews with others, they always liked it as well, but who doesn’t like free beer?  For me, the seed was planted quite a few years ago when I started winning homebrewing awards statewide.  It was then I began to realize that I was making more than just pretty good homebrew.  I was making some damn good beer!  I began volunteering to judge at homebrew competitions and making an effort to get out and sample more of the beers not available in northern Minnesota.  I quickly realized that there was much more to explore in the world of beer than I realized.  I studied and tasted everything I could find regarding brewing science and beer styles.  In the midst of all of the studying and research, I took the Beer Judge Certification Program test and obtained a National rank in the BJCP.  I now had some credentials to back up my knowledge of good beer and brewing.  It was clear that this was starting to become more than just a hobby, so I began to put a bit more time and effort into the dream of starting a brewery.    So, after all this research and planning, what’s the plan?  Start small.    Jack Pine Brewery is starting very small.  Nanobrewery small.  Brewing forty gallons at a time small.  Did I mention the brewer is small?    This little brewery serves as a pilot system for the eventual build-out of a full scale production brewery.  It provides the opportunity to test the waters before sinking a boatload of cash into a warehouse full of stainless equipment.  Best of all, it gives YOU a chance to TRY THE BEER!  I’ve been my own worst critic for the past 12 years of homebrewing.  Now it’s your turn.  With your help, we can build a brewery to provide our friends and neighbors with delicious locally-brewed beer.    So, stop in and give it a try!","","2012","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_6VMNdS-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_6VMNdS-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/3YeQjZ/upload_6VMNdS-large.png","Friday 4-7pm  Saturday 4-7pm","","2013","","",""

In 1918, the name was changed to a Lithuanian equivalent of Bergschlösschen, Kalnapilis.    Kalnapilis was taken over by Baltic Beverages Holding (established by Pripps of Sweden and Hartwall of Finland) in 1994. Ownership passed to Royal Unibrew in 2001, which merged the Kalnapilis with Tauras brewery in Vilnius into AB Kalnapilio-Tauro Grup?.    In April 1996, new fermentation and storage equipment enabled significantly different processing, the result being the introduction of three new brands. The brewery has an annual maximum capacity of 600,000 hectolitres.    Kalnapilis won 2 gold awards at the 2004 World Beer Cup, the Olympics of beer competitions; one in the German Style Heller Bock or Maibock category, for 'Kalnapilis 7.3', and one in the Muenchener style Helles category, for 'Kalnapilis Original'.

With several awards to our name and a growing demand for our beer, we took a huge leap and expanded into a brand new 12,000 square foot 30 barrel production facility in the south downtown area of Grand Junction near the Colorado River.  This new restaurant that also houses our production facility is known as Edgewater Brewery.

Beginning in 1996 with their now-famous Raspberry Wheat Ale and Pale Ale as draught-only selections in Ontario pubs, the brewery developed a strong following with beer connoisseurs.    The brewery added Nut Brown Ale and Cream Ale to their slate, and offered their ales in oversize 473mL bottles for sale at only at the brewery. This led to many beer pilgrimages by this writer to Peterborough to satisfy my thirst.    Luckily, Kawartha Lakes now distributes their Raspberry Wheat and Cream Ale in 12-packs in a growing number of Beer Stores. Due to the immense popularity of KLB beers, their Nut Brown Ale will also be available in Beer Stores beginning in September. Drinkers who desire their fine Pale Ale must still trek up to Central Ontario, but hopefully this brew will follow sometime in the future and round out their slate.    Kawartha Lakes was recently written up in the National Post, with the headline on March 8 reading: ""The last thing thriving Kawartha Lakes Brewing needs is more customers"".

(Although the building was built in the early 1800?s, the building was most recently home to the Woodstock Brewing Company.)    After months of cleaning and rebuilding, Keegan Ales brewed its first batch of beers on August 1, 2003(Tommy’s mom’s birthday) and set out hand-selling beer to local bars and restaurants early September. The first kegs of Old Capital, Hurricane Kitty and Mother’s Milk went to competition at Hunter Mountain that month.

His family was collecting rice from farmers as land taxes for the Mito Tokugawa family. He began his brewery with the idea of using the remaining rice stocks in the warehouse. At this time in Japan a new political movement began to reform the Tokugawa regime. Fujita Toko, one of the movement's activists, advocated an ideology to build a new organizational government with a reverence of the emperor, and his thought led to the Meiji Restoration.    Fujita was a close friend of Kiuchi, who named one of his sakes ""KIKUSAKARI"" as a respect to the emperor. KIKU (chrysanthemum) is a crest of the imperial household, and SAKARI means 'property'.    1950's Mikio Kiuchi inherited the brewery legacy in 1950. It was the time when the sake industry flourished as the rapid growth of Japan's economy after the World War II. Although many sake breweries started mass producing low quality sake due to increased demand, Kiuchi Brewery maintained their policy of pursuing the best quality of sake with the optimum ingredients and craftsman-ship.    Hitachino Beer In autumn 1996, Kiuchi started beer brewing business, named the brand ""HITACHINO NEST BEER"" with unique owl character logo.  Over the years, Kiuchi Brewery has gained Japan and worldwide attention by winning awards at numerous world beer competitions.  In 2000, Brew on Premises facilities has opened to introduce the Lager is the main stream in the beer industries in Japan.    Shochu Kiuchi Kiuchi built a Distillation facility in March, 2003. to aid with recycling and reduction of waste, beginning with the production of ""Shochu Kiuchi"" Distilled liquor made from Sakekasu (Sake lees) which is the by-product of Sake Brewing.    The wine brewing project is the latest challenge of Kiuchi Brewery. Kiuchi bought 4000 square meters of land next to the brewery for the vineyard. The grape seedlings, Merlot and Chardoney were imported from France. The vineyard produced its first crop in 2000.    In 2004, 3 tonnes of grapes were harvested producing 2000 Litres of Wine. This wine is hoped to be able to offer on a market as another prestigious Kiuchi brand in the near future...","392","","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/a2GCv8/upload_RGrlo5-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/a2GCv8/upload_RGrlo5-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/a2GCv8/upload_RGrlo5-large.png","","","","","",""

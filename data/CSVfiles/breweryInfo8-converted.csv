We support anything from school groups to ski clubs to horse rescue to the mentors program because, well, they support us and honestly it’s the right thing to do.    Dough. We like dough. It fits well in wallets and tastes good under cheese. We like to think we’ve got some good dough. We make pizza crust, we make sandwich bread, and we make finely crafted dog sweaters. Alright, we don’t make the last one, but we COULD if we wanted to. We take pride in the freshness of our dough and veggies. Our dough was made today. It wasn’t made in Topeka, frozen, shipped here, and warmed up. Ask who made it and he or she is probably in the kitchen.    Why no Straws? We know you didn’t get one. You’ll use them for about seven minutes and then we have to throw them away. It’s nothing personal. If you absolutely need one we’re happy to oblige, but we’re trying to reduce our non-recyclables, keep our landfills at a minimum, and keep plastic out of our oceans. Find a kid and ask them about plastic. Plastic pollutes our oceans and air, so we serve our beverages in glass. If you want to bring a kid cup from home, we’ll fill it up!    What, no Coasters? You’d be amazed at how many coasters we pick up off the floor. If our tables were Peruvian mahogany, inlaid with reclaimed oak from an historic church in New Brunswick, we’d say “heck yeah, give that pizza patron a coaster!” Let’s conserve together.    Hopefully you’re now thinking, “Wow Henrietta, these are some globally concerned restaurateurs.” But, then again, maybe you’re wondering about the lack of ice in the sodas? Are we trying to conserve ice bergs? Nope. We don’t even know any icebergs. Our soda’s are handmade with the finest extracts available, fantastic water and cane sugar. They’re served at cellar temps just like our beers, so you get a full flavored beverage that doesn’t need to be watered down. There’s a saying in Colorado, Whiskey’s for drinking, water’s for fighting. (We also have Whiskey, no fighting). If you want ice, just ask. We’ll not think less of you.

"DlWtXi","Thomas","As Natives of West Virginia, it has long been our dream to bring quality hand-crafted beer back to our state.    Originally from Elkins and Helvetia, we were raised on easy drinking beers and homemade wine. Curiosity eventually got the best of us, and we combined the two - our first batch of homebrew was conceived in the early 90's with home brewing equipment, books, and some ingredients handed down from our parent's home brewing days in the 70's.    Since then we've learned a lot about brewing professionally. We developed easy drinking and well rounded beers with our own state of the art brewing equipment. We sold our first beer in October 2005 and now we're distributing throughout the Canaan Valley, Davis, Thomas, Elkins, Morgantown and Fayetteville.    That's our story so far.

Moylan’s features a 57 foot long bar, a dart room with a fireplace and a reading library featuring brewing books and magazines from Brendan’s personal collection. By constructing the brewpub in an empty lot from his own vision, Moylan was able to increase efficiency and productivity, while still leaving room for expansion as the establishment’s popularity grows. According to Moylan, the location at Rowland Plaza provides good freeway visibility and helps attract a greater number of customers from the nearby theatre and corporate offices. When Moylan co-founded Marin Brewing Company back in 1989 there were only about a 100 brewpubs across the country.

"TavGRG","Mt. Begbie Brewing Company","Mt. Begbie Brewing was founded by Bart and Tracey Larson. Their love of beer and the quest for mountain living lured them to move to Revelstoke to create the brewery in 1996. Bart has a Phd in nuclear physics, but he prefers to make beer not war, right here in Revelstoke. And Bart hasn't let all that education stop him from making great beer. In fact, he's managed to combine his scientific background with an artistic, if somewhat bohemian, flair for beermaking to create what The Globe and Mail and Vancouver Province newspapers have called some of the best suds around.     Bart's brewery skills are complemented by Tracey's tenacious management and marketing skills. Tracey has a degree in biology; but she too is immersed in the brewing business. She probably comes closest to using skills learned in courses such as zoology when calling on remote bars to demo cold Begbies to rowdy, and thirsty, patrons.     The brewery has seen expansion since it's beginnings. Most significantly, the brewery moved to a larger location downtown, in an old car dealership, which now includes a tasting area and retail space.","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Revelstoke","British Columbia","V0E 2S0","250-837-2756","51.001247","-118.199425","N","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","CA","Canada","CAN","http://www.mt-begbie.com/","1996","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bVrLGO/upload_w69BJ7-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bVrLGO/upload_w69BJ7-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bVrLGO/upload_w69BJ7-large.png","521 1st Street West","124","","","","","",""

Think of this as your own internet brewpub where you can sidle up next to the brewmaster and ask a question — because you can.    What’s so Mysterious?    It’s a bit of a throwback. “Mystery” in its original definition meant the “art and craft of a trade.”  Brewers were among the first organized trade groups; there is evidence of a guild of brewers as early as 12th Century London: “the Master, Keepers or Wardens and Commonalty of the Mistery or Art of Brewers of the City of London”. So, it’s a tribute, it’s recognition that there is just as much art to brewing as there is science, and it’s a gentle reminder that to move forward and create a truly excellent future, sometimes you have to look at the past.","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Hillsborough","North Carolina","27278","919-697-8379","36.070686","-79.114137","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","http://www.mysterybrewing.com/","2011","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/L29NU9/upload_vN4pal-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/L29NU9/upload_vN4pal-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/L29NU9/upload_vN4pal-large.png","437 Dimmocks Mill Road","","2011","Tap Room:  Friday 6pm - 11pm  Otherwise, By Appointment Only","Suite 41","","http://eepurl.com/goT5b",""

"olQgtI","Nail Creek Pub & Brewery","Nail Creek Brewery is situated in the barn directly behind Nail Creek Pub. The origins and age of the barn are unfortunately unknown. About the only thing that I know is that the building is very old. The area of Utica where Nail Creek is located was once filled with breweries, malteries and all kinds of brewing industry. I am crossing my fingers and hoping that the barn was once involved in Utica’s brewing history.      The first year of the brewery’s operation will consist of true micro brewing. I’m talking about 20 gallon batches here… one keg at a time. Brewing will take place 2 to 3 times a week. The Primary focus of the first year will be to develop a few finalized, tweaked, end game recipes that I can set as a standard at the pub. I want to continually narrow down the recipes and processes until I have taken them to where I would be confident in sharing them with the worlds best brewers. The secondary focus is to experiment with different styles of beer and explore the art of brewing. Ideally, I would like to brew 3 times a week. The first two times would be to work on standardizing the two recipes and the third would simply be an experiment.","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Utica","New York","13502","315-793-7593","43.1035832","-75.243396","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","http://nailcreekpub.com/","","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/UwPt2I/upload_nCQHN5-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/UwPt2I/upload_nCQHN5-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/UwPt2I/upload_nCQHN5-large.png","720 Varick Street","","","Mon - Sat: 11:30 am - 2:00 am","","","",""

"R59V2j","Naked City Brewery & Taphouse","Once upon a time, there were two dudes named Donald and Don. One was an engineer toiling away on the super computers of a local university, and the other was a supervisor managing the complex operations of a local billionaire. Both of them loved their jobs, but more than their jobs they loved beer. Each Don had a recurring dream of a magical place without a name, a place where the great beers of the world flowed like the Salmon le Sac at flood stage, and the fine brewing tradition of the Pacific Northwest stood proudly beside the best concoctions from far-flung breweries in Asia and across Europe.    Don and Donald worked tirelessly in the wee hours on their home brew mixtures, searching for the best possible combination of hops, malt, barley, and love. For long years, the two Dons had their separate dreams, and never met. A local poet named Bryan had the pleasure of growing up with Donald, and worked for the same local billionaire as Don. After many months of hearing Don speak of his dream of the magical beer haven, Bryan knew it must be the very same place of which Donald had spoken too. He knew instinctively that it was his responsibility to bring the two Dons together. On a fateful summer afternoon at the Elysian Brewery on Capitol Hill, the two Dons met. The event later became known as THE HAPPY HOUR OF DESTINY.    Every patron in the pub knew something special was happening that day. The magical place both men dreamed of was one and the same. That very afternoon, the two Dons vowed to create a great beer haven right here on earth, and together they would name this magic place THE NAKED CITY. In THE NAKED CITY, it doesn't matter where you're going or where you've been, all that matters is great living and great beer. In THE NAKED CITY, the only problem is what great craft beer to try next. The two Dons spent a combined 25 years studying the world's great brewing traditions, and couldn't wait to begin experimenting together. Their very first batch of beer, an Oak-aged double IPA, took a ribbon in the Northwest regionals of the 2007 National Homebrew Competition. The rest, as they say, is history.    Two years after the two Dons combined their separate dreams, THE NAKED CITY opened its doors. Now Naked City boasts an award-winning brewery that produces a variety of small-batch beers available at the pub and friendly bars and restaurants in Seattle, Tacoma, Bellingham, and beyond. The 24 taps of THE NAKED CITY offer a constantly rotating variety of Washington's best beers, regional craft beers, and the best beers Donald and Don have found in two lifetimes of beer travels around the world.    Two and a half years after THE NAKED CITY was founded, the Dons convinced the local poet who brought them together to join them in the adventure. The Dons and Bryan together built a bigger brewery; a full-size kitchen; a dining room/movie theatre called The Screening Room that features free monthly events including film, comedy, poetry, community discusssion, and jazz; and now The Walrus Beer Garden, a patio that's home to murals by local artists, games, and summertime events.    So. Welcome to THE NAKED CITY, where great beer lovers flock like the salmon of Capistrano, and the only question is: WHAT TAP NEXT?","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Seattle","Washington","98103","206-838-6299","47.691833","-122.35509","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","http://www.nakedcitybrewing.com/","2008","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WF34ng/upload_s2ninP-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WF34ng/upload_s2ninP-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WF34ng/upload_s2ninP-large.png","8564 Greenwood Ave N","","","","","","",""

"YoA3mZ","Nelson Brewing Company","Since its inception in 1991, the Nelson Brewing Company has been dedicated to producing all natural, traditional, full-flavoured ales. In 2006 we decided to let the brewery evolve to an even more natural state, and by October of that year we were granted Certified Organic status. In a sense, we were getting back to our roots. People have been brewing organically for over 6000 years; the current practice of large-scale industrial farming with synthetic fertilizers and pesticides is an aberration of traditional farming, and therefore brewing, practices. Choosing organic production is also in keeping with the spirit of our home town of Nelson, a laid-back, progressive community nestled in the heart of the Kootenays. With limitless backcountry skiing and hiking at our back door, as well as a host of other outdoor activities year-round, brewing an organic beer in Nelson just seems like the natural thing to do.    What does it mean to be organic? Organic certification is a guarantee that our beer and its ingredients were produced without the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or genetic engineering. Our processes, cleaning and sanitation regimes must also adhere to a strict set of organic principles and be approved by our organic certification body. Being organic also signifies a commitment to environmental sustainability. Our goal is to eventually source all of our ingredients as locally as possible. Most of our barley is already malted right here in BC, and we are working with local farmers toward the planting of certified organic hops. Our spent materials are recycled by local farmers as feed and compost.","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Nelson","British Columbia","","1-250-352-3582","49.4883757","-117.2900382","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","CA","Canada","CAN","http://nelsonbrewing.com/","","","","","512 Latimer Street","124","","","","","",""

That's when the first batches of home-brewed beer began appearing and David's wife Lori began to realize that her husband was forming a lifetime passion.

The history of small family owned breweries that we able to serve fresh handcrafted beer to their local communities.  The fact that the these small local breweries became points of pride in the community and that the businesses would stay in the family for generations.       An idea began to grow.  The idea that despite the brewing world we live in now with mega breweries pumping out mass marketed bland beer, that a small locally owned brewery making fresh unique beer could again be a source of pride for a community.  David dreamed of recreating this American brewing tradition and so set out on his way to do just that.     David spent the next 7 years honing his craft.  Learning about beer styles and brewing techniques.  Winning contests with his beer and defining a unique style for quality and consistency.  In 2012 the wheels were set into motion for our brewery when David met Tyler Meusburger, a colleague with a passion for entrepreneurship and creativity.  Working together they began building a business plan and putting financing into place, and in Nov of 2013 David and Tyler brewed the first batch of beer at New American Brewing Co.

"x0saIe","Office","Buffalo, New York welcomed in the 20th century with the Pan American Exposition.  It was a time of amazing progress.  Electricity was cutting-edge technology, and the possibilities seemed endless.  Hard times lay ahead for the country and for Buffalo though; The Great War would rage and The Great Depression would last for nearly a decade before the United States would emerge from the second World War as the leader of the Free World.    What does any of that have to do with a startup craft-brewery?  The New Buffalo Brewing Co. shares the same passion for progress.  Buffalo produced over half a million barrels of brew in 1896, but by the end of the 1970's, production halted to almost zero.

"jzO9Iv","New England Brewing Company","New England Brewing Co. is a microbrewery based in Woodbridge, CT that crafts a handful of savory brews including Atlantic Amber, Elm  City Lager, and Sea Hag IPA.    Owner and brewer Rob Leonard started making beer in his kitchen. Like many home brewers he eventually grew in knowledge and recipes and wanted to make more and different beers.    He landed that home brewers dream job at New Haven Brewing in 1992 cleaning kegs and packing cases. But his obvious passion for the brewing craft led him to the title assistant brewer and eventually head brewer in short three years. At that time he joined forces with former NHB colleague Blair Potts to run Quality Assured Brewing, a consulting service for microbreweries throughout the North East. 1996 saw Rob as the Brew Master for both the Manchester and Westport, CT locations in The John Harvard’s Brew House chain. While there, Rob won a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival in the German Altbier category. Southern Connecticut, especially Norwalk, took a liking to Rob and that was where he became the brewmaster and operations manager for New England Brewing. He learned the sales end of beer and when the owners wanted to get out of the brewery business, Rob immediately took the opportunity to acquire the name of the company and re-locate the whole business just down the street from the kitchen where he first started making beer.","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Woodbridge","Connecticut","06525","203-387-2222","41.3389393","-72.9816961","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","http://newenglandbrewing.com/","2001","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rAHla4/upload_nljup8-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rAHla4/upload_nljup8-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rAHla4/upload_nljup8-large.png","7 Selden St","","2001","","","","",""

"KzHweV","Ninkasi Brewing Company","In late 2005, Nikos Ridge and Jamie Floyd met at a favorite local bottle  shop in Eugene, Ore. Nikos was sampling a beer Jamie had brewed at a local  restaurant/brewery and through mutual friends, the two started talking.  The conversation landed on the question, “What would you do if you could  open your own brewery?” With Nikos’ background in finance and Jamie’s  experience in brewing, it seemed like a good skillset for starting a brewery.  The two began brewing about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when  Nikos and Jamie spent 17 hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination  IPA. The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German  restaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped  with a 15-barrel brew house. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one  soul driving purpose—through the creation of the highest quality beers;  to improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its  employees, and business partners.    Both founders knew they wanted to do things differently—within the beer  industry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape  was home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company  that represented what beer meant to them—a source of community and  the root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi—the Sumerian goddess of  fermentation—was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer  not only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but  was also the center of community and culture, one never in operation  without the other—a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to  find property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real  estate in Eugene’s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its  current location in 2007.  Since then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to produce more  beer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility,  tasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the  focus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi’s culture continues to embody  “Believe in the Goddess”—symbolizing the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated  human experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer.  The current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system, with a capacity of  95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska,  California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.  The Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series, has grown from  its first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA,  Believer Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout,  and Quantum Pale Ale. Today, the Ninkasi family of brands includes its  Flagship, Seasonal Release, Special Release, Prismatic Lager, Single Hop,  and R&D Series.","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Eugene","Oregon","97402","877-7-NINKASI","44.056855","-123.10988","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","http://www.ninkasibrewing.com/","2006","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V4I9FT/upload_V8Ophh-large.png","272 Van Buren St","","2006","","","","",""

NoDa Brewing is a 15 barrel brewery creating the highest quality beers for local restaurants and pubs, as well as our tap room.  Our beer styles will have a Northwestern feel, showcasing American Pale Ales, India Pale Ales, and Porters.  Our small size gives us the flexibility to introduce many unique and artistic recipes as well as our renditions of classic varieties such as Imperial Stouts, Wit beers, and Winter Warmers.  Our Head Brewer frequently traveled to Europe over the past couple years.  He has been fortunate to have experienced the wonderful beers that have historically defined many current craft beer styles.  As we pay homage to these great and historic beers, we’ll add an American Flair that will be embraced in the Carolinas and beyond.","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Charlotte","North Carolina","28205","(704) 900-6851","35.240347","-80.814842","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","http://www.nodabrewing.com/","2011","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/pcrctk/upload_B1Dsle-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/pcrctk/upload_B1Dsle-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/pcrctk/upload_B1Dsle-large.png","2229 North Davidson St","","2011","Monday - 4 - 8:30  Tuesday - 4-8:30  Wednesday - 4-9  Thursday- 4-8:30  Friday - 4-9:30  Saturday - 12-10  Sunday - 1-6","","","",""

I chose the name North by Northwest because I wanted to convey the image of the Northwest where many brew pubs and micro-breweries got their start. Once settling on the name,the architecture and the image flowed naturally. Stone and wood are combined with the high vaulted ceiling to create the feel of those great lodges in our Northwest National parks.We have urbanized it a bit with the steel structure and industrial designed light fixtures. The Brewery Tower is a prominent feature along with the NXNW grain silos. The one directly in front of the Brewery Tower is a functioning silo full of 25,000 lbs. of barley – the major component ofthe beer making process.

Instead of having a few flagship beers available at all times, we release two new beers each month. These are only around while they last and then will be supplanted by the next styles in line. You can think about it as brewing only *seasonals* such as a stout or a winter warmer in the winter, a nice malty brown in the fall, or a refreshing kolsch or hefeweizen in the summer. However, the best received ones will get duplicated (but not that often) and quite possibly may become flagship beers down the line.","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Seattle","Washington","98107","206-853-0525","47.664834","-122.378656","Y","N","N","Y","nano","Nano Brewery","US","United States","USA","http://www.nwpeaksbrewery.com/","2010","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eRdXNO/upload_SVLiaS-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eRdXNO/upload_SVLiaS-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eRdXNO/upload_SVLiaS-large.png","4912 17th Avenue Northwest","","","","Suite B","","",""

The 163-acre natural wetlands was Portland’s first urban wildlife refuge and is home to more than 125 species of birds, including the Great Blue Heron that is our symbol.    The term “Public House” was used in Old England to describe homes that innkeepers, or publicans, who were seeking a warm meal, a cold (but not too cold) pint and possibly a comfy bed. While we don’t offer lodging (and can’t let you snooze in our booths), it is our intent to offer neighbors from near and far good food and good drink in a friendly and relaxed atmosphere.    A good public house should be an example of what sociologist Ray Oldenburg calls a “third place”- a friendly, comfortable haven where guests can leave behind the cares of the “first place” (home) and “second place” (work) and enjoy the company of friends while someone else cooks the food and does the dishes.","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Portland","Oregon","97202","503-232-1728","45.4738362","-122.6494855","Y","N","N","Y","brewpub","Brewpub","US","United States","USA","http://www.newoldlompoc.com/oaksbottom_home.html","","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RmKWl4/upload_l2WeOQ-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RmKWl4/upload_l2WeOQ-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RmKWl4/upload_l2WeOQ-large.png","1621 SE Bybee","","","","","","",""

"TWs0Z9","Obolon Joint Stock Company","The corporation’s history dates back to 1974 when the construction site of the future brewery was sand filled. The start-up of production was dedicated to the 1980 Olympic Games.    Czech experts were engaged in the project as world-renowned brewmasters. They were the ones who identified the construction site for the new brewery. The choice of construction site was determined by the main factor, namely the availability of huge reserves of soft, crystal-clear water. Today, the water from Jurassic bedrock (290 m) ensures the high quality of our products.    Soon afterwards, the enterprise gave the impetus to developing the largest corporation in Ukraine to produce beer, low alcohol and soft drinks, and mineral water.    The plant received its current name only in 1986, after the district of Kyiv with the same name. The word ‘Obolon’ comes from the times of Kievan Rus, when it denoted low riverside meadows.    Built according to a Czech design, the brewery produced beer that gained wide popularity. After Ukraine became independent, Obolon was the first corporation to export hopped beverages to Europe and the USA. Obolon trademark beer started being perceived as traditional Ukrainian beer in the whole world.    After a quarter of a century, Obolon has evolved into a world-renowned trademark. Today people on five continents associate Obolon with Ukrainian beer #1.","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Kyiv","","04655","+38(044) 412-84-10","44.678833","-67.404638","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","UA","Ukraine","UKR","http://obolon.ua/","1980","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8FRtPM/upload_AHayaK-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8FRtPM/upload_AHayaK-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/8FRtPM/upload_AHayaK-large.png","3 Bogatyrska Street","804","1980","","","","",""

After some early batches with extracts, it took less than a year to trade up to all-grain brewing in a friend's basement apartment. The youngest of six in a family of caterers, he may have it in his genes to provide others with food and drink, and the early experiments proved a hit at weekly parties on Missoula's University Avenue. Dan tried his hand at the homebrew standards--stouts, porters, English-style ales, etc.--but also made a mean hefeweizen (no lemon, please), alt, marzen, dunkel, and other Continental styles. Since moving to Portland in 2001, he's quenched the thirst of friends, neighbors and guests--not just college partygoers but beer geeks who live in Beervana for a reason. After a slight detour for law school and the cat-herding world of criminal defense, Dan swapped his back-porch setup for a bigger set of kettles and fermenters.","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Portland","Oregon","97203","503-810-7920","45.5888297","-122.7609782","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","http://occidentalbrewing.com/","2003","","","","6635 N.

"oPxIne","Ocelot Brewing Company","Craft beer is a passion, an obsession and a journey. This journey has opened our eyes (and taste buds) to some of the finest examples of beer this planet has to offer. Our tastes and expectations have forever changed, and so have our methods of enjoyment. From beer trades, to home brewing, to attending release parties and festivals one thing became clear… We rarely drink the same beer over and over again, and we love to share.    Our IPAs will be constantly revolving depending on inspiration, hop variety, availability, and season. We will make everything from low gravity Sessions, to Regulars, Doubles, Triples and even a San Diego Pale Ale or two. We will make sure these styles are released, distributed, and tapped… FRESH!    We like big beers and we cannot lie! From the biggest Russian Imperial Stouts aged in spirit barrels to malty Double Reds, Smooth Porters, and velvety Wee Heavies, we just can’t get enough of these complex beauties. Thick mouthfeel, high gravity, and rich flavors suitable for aging to be shared with family and friends. Crack one open to celebrate a special occasion, or just because its a Tuesday.    Mouth puckering sour ales is another style which we adore. One which we hoard, savor, and curse for not being more readily available. Using wine barrels from local Virginia Wineries we will age some carefully crafted super tart ales, blending them when needed and using fruits for character. Once the bugs catch up to our pipeline, expect a new sour to be released every month.    At Ocelot, we love two things… Beer and Music!    We believe in inspiration. It can come in many forms and varies from person to person. For us, music has always been our inspiration. Music has been the soundtrack to our lives and has in one way or another crafted every decision we’ve made. We aim to create and dedicate our beers to the music that has inspired our journey through life.    Ocelot Brewing Company is a reflection of us, our styles, and our habits. From chasing freshies to cellaring whales and everything in between. We will craft many different beers in small batches. We brew beer we want to drink when we want to drink it. Come by and visit, listen to some tunes, grab a pint, fill a growler, and join us on this adventure.","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Sterling","Virginia","20166","(703) 474-3050","38.960326","-77.5030993","Y","Y","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","http://ocelotbrewing.com/","2013","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Qvbd2N/upload_umGWaC-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Qvbd2N/upload_umGWaC-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Qvbd2N/upload_umGWaC-large.png","23600 Overland Drive","","","","#180","","",""

We realized a long time ago that food-friendly by no means needs to be less flavorful, and we actually add ingredients to widen the palate of our beers above and beyond their original styles.    To better integrate with a meal and make our beers more ‘sessionable’ in general, we utilize highly attenuating yeasts to dry out our beers to make them less sweet and filling, then replace that desired sweetness with an addition outside the norm, such as Juniper, Ginger or even Angelica. These ingredients are always kept at a level to avoid building a ‘spice beer’, and always present themselves as a unique and complementary addition. We also focus on extremely clean finishes, and use the entire recipe to build bittering rather than just using the hops to reduce lingering starchiness.    In the end, the true beauty of any flavor is in the eye (and mouth) of the beholder. Read about our beers here, then taste them at your local restaurant or store and judge for yourself if we have truly crafted ‘Great Beer Designed With Great Food In Mind’. We believe we have.","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Seattle","Washington","98108","206-762-3909","47.5215611","-122.3133644","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","http://www.odinbrewing.com/","2009","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V8LP7a/upload_fjClZJ-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V8LP7a/upload_fjClZJ-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/V8LP7a/upload_fjClZJ-large.png","9130 15th Pl S","","","","Suite F","","",""

"I4hZZy","Odyssey Beerwerks","Back when the world was a much different place, filled with grunge music, loose fitting clothes, and Wayne’s World movies, two shady characters fell in together and started doing various sketch and wonderful things. One of these was brewing . . . beer. Not the tasty, modern, complex craft beers flowing in today’s market, but the goofy and “just OK” beers that home brewers in the 90’s seemed to know how to build. These guys (we’ll call them Chris and Josh for lack of anonymity’s sake) got better at brewing over the years, even as they moved apart.    Chris went down a corporate marketing path; Josh seemed to prefer engineering and operations; both still enjoyed beer and, with lots of practice, the homebrew got better and better. When Y2K sputtered out before it even came to life, the two had their first discussion about opening a brewery. More life happened. More of the guys’ improving craft beers were served at more home parties. When they got together again more recently, the topic resurfaced, but this time it wouldn’t go away. And gradually a brewery was born.    20 years since the start of their homebrew hobbies, Odyssey Beerwerks was formed to do the impossible: take an enjoyable hobby of creating fine craft beers and make it into a dreary job, with the benefit of bringing new and exciting hand crafted beers onto our vibrant planet.","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Arvada","Colorado","80002","(303) 421-0772","39.8007911","-105.0589359","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","http://www.odysseybeerwerks.com/","2011","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zMORP4/upload_73PUUD-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zMORP4/upload_73PUUD-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zMORP4/upload_73PUUD-large.png","5535 W 56th Ave,","","2011","M-Th 3-9  F-Sa 2-10  Su Noon-7","Suite 107","","https://www.facebook.com/OdysseyBeerwerks/app_100265896690345",""

In 2006, the brewery sold the equivalent of 27,000 barrels of beer and 6,000 barrels of soft drink, making Old Dominion the 50th-largest brewery in the country.

"A7Nqfu","Old Forge Brewing Company","Old Forge Brewing Company is a fun, casual, comfortable brewpub, specializing in healthy pub fare and fresh brewed beer.    Our country was built on the skills and labor of old-world artisanal craftsmen. Woodworkers, carpenters, stonemasons, ironworkers, blacksmiths, tileworkers, and many others came here and employed the knowledge and skills of their craft in building their farms, homes, and towns.    Nowadays, it is so easy and convenient to purchase generic products from big-box stores, that we sometimes neglect to appreciate the uniqueness and quality of a hand-crafted product.    At Old Forge Brewing Company, we strive to honor personal craftsmanship. Our hand-crafted beer is made in small batches to ensure quality and peak freshness, while the healthy and delicious menu has ingredients sourced from local farms and markets wherever possible. Take the time to notice our bar, furniture, and fixtures which were all handcrafted by local wood and metal worker Keith Kocher (Lightstreet Custom Woodworking). Check out our unique tap handles carved and forged by local artist/sculptor J. Mark Irwin (Irwin Sculpture Studio), and our plates, bowls, and beer mugs, all hand-made by local potter Mike Hart (M.

The only exception is the hops which are imported from abroad because the weather conditions in Finland are not conducive to growing sufficiently high quality crops.    OLVI beers differ from one another in the selection of their raw materials as well as in their manufacturing methods. Olvi allows its beers to mature slowly and gradually, which is the only way as there is no shortcut to success.    All Olvi's beers are lager beers, which means that they are produced with bottom-fermenting yeast. Lager beers are either dark or light. The bottom-fermenting yeast ferments the beers in a cool temperature, which produces a very fresh, crisp taste and aroma.

One Love Brewery has partnered up with The 7th Settlement Brewing Company to build and share a custom made 7-barrel brewery premise, located downtown Dover at 47 Washington Street. By forming this alliance, two very different brewers will be able to share the same brewing premises, equipment, overhead expenses and even marketing tools such as pint glasses and coasters.    Veteran brewer Michael Snyder and partner Jennifer Riley, plan on having rotating styles of beers. Because of limited fermentation space at start up, both breweries will focus on ale style beers. Ales take about 3 weeks to produce, where as a lager can takes twice as long.    “One Love means different things to different people.” Says Michael.  “For us, it’s about the love of being connected with the outdoors and the positive experiences it provides for us. We are firm believers in creating our own life experience; we go after it, one day at a time. We try to keep everything local when every possible or feasible.

"Xz6lr3","Our Mutual Friend Malt & Brew","Our Mutual Friend is a brewery and taproom located in the Five Points neighborhood of Denver. For us, brewing beer began as an excuse to gather with our friends and ruminate on life, philosophy, music, food, and of course, beer. Once we got started, we grew more curious about the brewing process, honing our craft and experimenting with different methods and techniques. Along the way a fundamental question to our process was, how can we do more of this ourselves? Our desire to participate in every step of the grain to glass process led us to open Our Mutual Friend.    At OMF, our goal is to use local sources to brew local ales. This is why we malt and roast as much of the grain we use in our beer as we can. As a small maltstery, we have more influence over the quality and freshness of the beers we pour in our taproom, and more opportunities to source our ingredients locally. 100 percent of our barley is grown right here in Colorado. And as much as possible, we source our hops and specialty ingredients from farms in our state.     Part of what we love about beer is its power to bring people together (hence our name!). We’re excited to be a gathering place in the Five Points neighborhood where locals and visitors alike can meet in camaraderie alongside a quality pint of ale. We believe in the power of neighborly acts and the spirit of neighbors taking care of one another within the local community. We at OMF support and strive for the Denver community to know each other better and enjoy a good pint in the same process.     We are excited to see our city developing a local, world-class brewery community, and look forward to building relationships with our friends and neighbors, and collaborating with other breweries to cherish our Denver home and protect our collective local influence.","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Denver","Colorado","80205","(720) 722-2810","39.760595","-104.982712","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","http://www.omfmb.com/","2012","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Ij1ASf/upload_nGDJ35-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Ij1ASf/upload_nGDJ35-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Ij1ASf/upload_nGDJ35-large.png","2810 Larimer Street","","2012","Thu: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm  Fri: 4:00 pm - 12:00 am  Sat: 2:00 pm - 12:00 am  Sun: 2:00 pm - 10:00 pm","","","",""

We usually do not brew the same beer twice, but will do so if enough people ask.    By definition, an outlander is a stranger, a foreigner, but here he is much more. This is how we see him: The outlander is the innovator; he is the one who drives change. It is the outlander, whether in mind or origin, who represents the ambitious, passionate pioneer who is willing to put everything on the line in order to make his dream come true. It’s often a simple dream, a dream to share his knowledge, his expertise with the ones who call him stranger. And certainly the public may reject his ideas, they may cast him back to where he came from. But does this ever worry the outlander? Never. Because the outlander believes in his ideas. He knows what he is offering is great and he knows others, once they put aside their prejudice, will know this too. He knows that someone who has invested their time, their life, their hopes and dreams behind something cannot fail. And he knows one last vital piece of information– that there have been many outlanders in this world before him and there will be many more to come.","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Seattle","Washington","98103","(206) 486-4088","47.652227","-122.3555637","Y","N","N","Y","brewpub","Brewpub","US","United States","USA","http://outlanderbrewing.com/","2012","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4iDXFJ/upload_pLt4tJ-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4iDXFJ/upload_pLt4tJ-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4iDXFJ/upload_pLt4tJ-large.png","225 N.36th St.","","2012","Monday – Closed  Tuesday – 4pm – 10pm  Wednesday – 4pm – 10pm  Thursday – 4pm – 12am  Friday – 4pm – 1am  Saturday – 2pm – 1am  Sunday – 2pm– 10pm","","","",""

Jay, at this time, owned an old manufacturing warehouse on Cabot Street in Holyoke. He soon incorporated the Paper City Brewery, Co., Inc. From here the wheels were in motion, Jay spent most of his time in transforming the fifth floor of the warehouse into a functional, federally and state approved, micro-brewery. Under the supervision of head brewer Rick Quackenbush the brewery put out its first brew of Holyoke Dam Ale in November of 1996.    Today, Paper City Brewery continues to grow with the addition of a new Head Brewer Ben Anhalt, Assistant Brewer, Jason Todd and an additional flagship beer, Ireland Parish Golden Ale.

The monks had brewed beer for their own use since 1634. The beer that was permitted to be sold on holidays was a Bock style which gained local fame. After the abolition of the Neudeck Cloister in 1799, the building was converted into a penitentiary. Franz Xaver Zacherl, the brewer, purchased the former cloister brewery and continued the Starkbier tradition with the product Salvator, which is latin for Saviour. In 1861 the Salvatorkeller (Salvator cellar) was opened upon Nockherberg. In 1928 the brewery merged with the Gebrüder Thomas brewery creating Paulaner Salvator Thomas Bräu. 1994 saw the acquisition into the Kulmbacher brewery group with the affiliated producers Plauen and Chemnitz. A daughter company is the Auer Bräu AG Rosenheim. Paulaner belongs to the BHI (Brau Holding International AG), a joint venture between Schörghuber Ventures (50.1%) and with Holland's Heineken N.V.

Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles. Once we're stocked up on the core brews we'll start pumping out regular seasonal or specialty brews.

"NkKRig","Pig's Eye Brewing Company","Pig's Eye Brewing Company was established in 2002.  The previous owner of the Pig's Eye brands, Minnesota Brewing Company, had gone out of business in June of that year.  We (two former Minnesota Brewing Company employees - Phil Gagne', the Brewmaster, and Jeff Crawford, the VP of Sales) formed Pig's Eye Brewing Company, and purchased the Pig's Eye brands from ... Minnesota Brewing company's creditors in September 2002.     With the old brewery closed, and  limited resources at our disposal, we applied for, and received, permission from the Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau to brew as an ""alternating proprietor"" at City Brewing Company - La Crosse, WI; a brewery with a longstanding brewing heritage, and a commitment to quality.  As an ""alternating proprietor"", we are a ""brewery within a brewery"", essentially renting brewing and packaging equipment from City whenever we are brewing and packaging our products.    Our inaugural brews of Pig's Eye Pilsner and Pig's Eye Light were started on February 18, 2003, with the 1st product run was on March 25, 2003.  To the chagrin of some of our loyal customers, we made the decision to drop the ""Pirate"" rendering of ""Pig's Eye"" from our packaging, in favor of a historically accurate portrayal of Pierre ""Pig's Eye"" Parrant.  In May 2004, in response to consumer interest in low-carb products, we replaced Pig's Eye Light with Pig's Eye Lean Light (the original Pig's Eye light beer).  Our product line expanded again in January 2006 - with the introduction of Pit Bull High Gravity Ice Malt Liquor, and again in June 2007 - with the re-introduction of Pig's Eye Ice.  We  also, for a short period of time, operated as an alternating proprietorship and packaged 24/12 Returnable Bottles at Stevens Point Brewery- Stevens Point, WI, but had to discontinue the production of the returnable bottle package due to increases in packaging costs.     We started out in 2002 as a 2 man owner/operator brewer, and remain so to this day.  Beer is our life, and our livelihood - We, and our families, appreciate your interest and support!","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","St. Paul","Minnesota","55129","651-734-1661","44.922333","-92.901392","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","http://www.pigseyebeer.com/","2002","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JjzyTT/upload_cGcq3E-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JjzyTT/upload_cGcq3E-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JjzyTT/upload_cGcq3E-large.png","10107 Bridgewater Parkway","","2002","","","","",""

"EhUsAz","Pine Street Brewery","When asked, “Why we started brewing?” The common response back in 2009 was, “We like arts and crafts”. The brewing began in a small apartment kitchen on Pine St. in San Francisco on a stove that could hardly generate a boil. During the first night, it became apparent that we could create the beer that we wanted to drink and the collective that became Pine Street Brewery (PSB) was born. That was goal from the first night of brewing—it was love at first smell.    PSB moved into the historic Bourne Mansion in Pacific Heights during the Spring of 2010 and called this home until the Fall of 2011. Regular weekly brewing led to lots of experimentation and ten recipes that have become part of the core beer list. During “Brew Nights,” friends were made, a community was fostered and a brand was started.    Pine Street Brewery was designed so that our products would be available for many different palates in many different communities. There is a unique Pine Street in almost every area. We intend for our beer, interpretations of classic styles, to unite people across the US, one beer at a time.    Our philosophy is to provide a celebration through ales and togetherness. We are active in the community through volunteer work and partnerships with local charities.","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","San Francisco","California","94108","415-744-4062","37.79179","-122.407419","Y","Y","N","N","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","http://www.pinestreetbrewery.com/","2010","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/XSfRBX/upload_Mhj095-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/XSfRBX/upload_Mhj095-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/XSfRBX/upload_Mhj095-large.png","","","","","","","",""

"TKwUTr","Piney River Brewing Company","Founded in 2010, Piney River Brewing Company is a microbrewery dedicated to making distinctive craft beers that celebrate life in the Ozarks. Joleen and Brian Durham, owners, have lived and farmed in Texas County for many years, and they have enjoyed craft beer for a long time, too.    Today, Joleen and Brian live up the hill from the Little Piney River that flows into the Big Piney.  They benefit from multiple fresh water springs and a waterfall on their farm, and they continually find themselves drawn to the rivers that flow around their farm and throughout the Ozarks.    Joleen and Brian first made beer on the kitchen stove, fermenting it in the basement of their 100-year old farm house.  In July 2010 they partnered together to revive a 70-year old barn made from red and white oak trees harvested off the farm, and Piney River Brewing Company was born.    The barn, rechristened BARn, is home to Piney River Brewing Company.  Joleen and Brian began the craft brewery as a “nanobrewery”, brewing on a 10-gallon Sabco system.  In the fall of 2011, a 7-barrel brewhouse with an automatic canning line was put in place for the microbrewery.

"fVTmDq","Pinglehead Brewing Company","We’ve been commercially making beer for our friends, neighbors and visitors of Brewer’s Pizza in Orange Park since early 2011. All that time Brewer’s has been serving Pinglehead Brewing Company’s handcrafted beers along side of some of the highest ranked beers America has to offer. The goal was to truly understand how our beer would stack up against the best of the best. Based on what Brewer’s customers have to say, our beers are not just competitive, they are usually their first choice.    If you really love pale yellow light lager, drinkable only when served ice cold (and in a frosted mug), then DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME TRYING OUR BEER. You probably won’t be able to appreciate it. If those awesome Superbowl beer commercials have convinced you that you “belong”, DON’T BOTHER LOOKING OUR WAY! Our craftsmen make BIG BEER, full of flavor with the most incredible ingredients available. We call it “Beer with Attitude!”    Venturing out beyond the walls of Brewer’s Pizza, Pinglehead Brewing Company will enable many others to enjoy their very own“Beer with Attitude!”","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Orange Park","Florida","32073","904-276-5159","30.1884634","-81.7394758","Y","N","N","Y","brewpub","Brewpub","US","United States","USA","http://www.pinglehead.com/","","","","","14 Blanding Boulevard","","","","Suite B","","",""

"5efIdI","Pinnacle Peak Patio Steakhouse & Microbrewery","When first opened in 1957, the Pinnacle Peak was a general store and rest stop for travelers heading to nearby lakes. To boost sales of his small business, the owner decided to serve dinner on the weekends. It was a great success - and the rest is restaurant history. What started as a weekend cookout has grown into the world's largest western steakhouse with seating for 1800 people inside and outside for 2000.    Pinnacle Peak Patio is renowned for its delicious mesquite broiled steaks, casual western atmosphere, and its ""NO NECKTIE POLICY."" This ""no necktie"" tradition was started one night when a Phoenix executive came in for dinner. The original owner, wanting to keep the atmosphere in his restaurant casual, told the executive, ""Either you take that tie off, or I'll cut it off."" The executive did not take heed and was appalled when the owner pulled out a butcher knife and promptly cut off the offending cravat.    Wanting to be recognized as a victim of this absurd policy, the executive demanded that his tie be prominently displayed for all to see. The necktie was stapled to the rafters along with a business card identifying its victim. Pinnacle Peak is very serious about its ""no necktie"" policy and has cut over a million ties from unsuspecting customers.","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Scottsdale","Arizona","85255","1-480-563-5133","33.7268223","-111.8531069","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","http://pppatio.com","","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Neba3O/upload_OLyV4w-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Neba3O/upload_OLyV4w-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Neba3O/upload_OLyV4w-large.png","10426 East Jomax Road","","","","","","",""

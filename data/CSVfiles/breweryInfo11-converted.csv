When Jim explained that in Oregon, where he came of age, there was a vibrant scene of restaurants and bars that housed their own microbreweries that crafted their own distinct beers that could only be enjoyed at the source, Gantt understandably replied, ""$#@*!"".    What began as a conversation soon became an obsession and, in 1996, the firm Warner and Worth was incorporated to see their shared dream come true.","http://thecannonbrewpub.com/","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","1041 Broadway","Columbus","Georgia","31901","706-653-2337","","32.4663533","-84.9935198","Y","N","N","Y","brewpub","Brewpub","US","United States","USA","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9vSKac/upload_RxpDNZ-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9vSKac/upload_RxpDNZ-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/9vSKac/upload_RxpDNZ-large.png","","1996","1996","","",""

All of our beer is made within the four walls of our restaurant, which means that when it hits your glass it is the freshest beer you can get.   Our beers are never filtered or pasteurized and are always full of character and flavor.  We brew styles from American and Belgian to anything in between.  We typically brew our beers with four ingredients: malt, hops, yeast and San Antonio water.   However we have been known to add things like coffee, fruit, spices, and anything else that might catch our fancy.    At The Granary we love beer as beer helps to enrich our lives.  We take our beer and food seriously and we hope to politely challenge people’s perspective of how beer can be paired with food.  We believe that every meal that is served can be made better when paired with the right style of beer.

"IdIInN","Fitchburg","The Great Dane Pub & Brewing Company was established by college friends Eliot Butler and Rob LoBreglio. The two dreamed of starting a Brewpub that offered many varieties of house-brewed ales and lagers and hearty made-from-scratch pub fare to accompany the beers. The original Downtown location opened in November 1994 and expanded with the addition of a pool hall in 1996. The wild success of the first Great Dane led to the decision to open more pubs in the Madison area.    The Fitchburg Great Dane began operations in 2002 and the Hilldale pub followed in 2006. In 2009, the Hilldale pub expanded its brewery and opened a 4,000 square foot pool hall. Additionally, in May of 2009, the first Great Dane outside of the Madison area debuted in Wausau, Wisconsin. The Wausau Great Dane added a 100 seat beer garden and outdoor bar in the spring of 2011. In November 2010, the fifth Great Dane began operations in Grandview commons, off of Cottage Grove Road on Madison's east side.","http://fitchburg.greatdanepub.com/","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","2980 Cahill Main","Fitchburg","Wisconsin","53711","608-442-9000","Monday- Thursday 11AM-2AM, Friday-Saturday 11AM-230AM, Sunday 10AM-2AM","43.0177229","-89.423194","N","N","N","Y","restaurant","Restaurant/Ale House","US","United States","USA","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fonllb/upload_tSsIUh-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fonllb/upload_tSsIUh-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fonllb/upload_tSsIUh-large.png","","1996","","http://www.greatdanepub.com/email-list-signup","",""

He has been homebrewing since the 90′s, and has graduated from the American Brewers Guild with a Craft Brewers Apprenticeship (CBA) in 2010. He apprenticed at the Real Ale Brewery in Blanco, and began brewing at the Root Cellar in 2012. The house beers brewed by Robert are Alison’s Ale, Cream Steam, Santa Fe Stout, and a Gluten Free IPA.    Alison’s Ale - A highly complex, clean and refreshing taste with a blend of six different malts and three different hops.    Cream Steam - Steam Beers are in a category all their own. Is it a lager? Is it an ale? Actually, it’s a lager brewed at ale temperatures. This higher temperature fermentation produces a beer with more “fruity” qualities than your average lager. The hops are 100% Northern Brewer, but Robert has lowered the hop bill to make this Steam Beer a bit more creamy and smooth.    Santa Fe Stout – This dry Stout, moderately bittered with Kent Golding hops, has flavor notes that remind me of a cup of dark coffee sipped from a warm mug on a cold Santa Fe morning.

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain “not normal” by conventional standards.    In November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.","http://www.threefloydspub.com/","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-10-20 15:53:00","9750 Indiana Parkway","Munster","Indiana","46321","1-219-922-3565","","41.535536","-87.516687","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_WREfmT-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_WREfmT-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iodDki/upload_WREfmT-large.png","","1996","1996","","",""

"06ughl","Tin Whiskers Brewery and Taproom","The three founders of Tin Whiskers Brewing Co., LLC are George Kellerman, Jake Johnson, and Jeff Moriarty. They first met in 2005 while going to the University of Minnesota for bachelor degrees in Electrical Engineering. Over time, they all worked together as hardware design engineers for a small engineering services company specializing in RF-centric products. Being young engineers working downtown Minneapolis, they attended various happy hours together. It quickly became clear that they all really loved craft beer and were very intrigued with the science of the brewing process.    Jake and Jeff are the two brewers of the company who designed and honed the recipes. They got their start in 2006 brewing extract kits on Jake's Mom's kitchen stove much to her chagrin. (A few boil-overs did occur on her stove, whoops!) They brewed countless extract kits until in 2010, when after touring Surly and Flat Earth, they were inspired to turn their passion (like the founders of those breweries) into a business. From that point forward it has been all grain brewing and loving it. Nowadays, Jake focuses on the brewing aspect of the business while Jeff focuses on the brewing as well as the business side of the operation.    George, in the early years, was a force within the brewery by helping out at every brew session and providing needed muscle for cleaning and moving material around the brewhouse. He focused a lot on the quality of our beer and pushed us to design better more complex beers. He has moved on to be in charge of our online presence including developing our own beer wiki engine.","http://twbrewing.com/","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","125 E 9th St.","St. Paul","Minnesota","55101","(651) 330-4734","Wednesday: 4-10PM  Thursday 4-10PM  Friday 3-11PM  Saturday 12-11PM","44.9506615","-93.09361","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HhKKA6/upload_Oo4Qmh-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HhKKA6/upload_Oo4Qmh-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HhKKA6/upload_Oo4Qmh-large.png","Unit 127","2014","2014","","",""

Taken over in 1900 by John Good and renamed Tivoli, this brewery would become one of the largest breweries in the West, selling its light golden lager nearly everywhere west of the Mississippi until closing its doors in 1969.

The three talked about that it was too bad that you could not get some decent beer and agreed that the only way to ensure quality was about to brew it yourself. They were allowed to borrow the canteen in the school's closing and began to brew. This meant however that most of the brew was made between the hours of 22 and 6 on weekdays, which resulted in some hard school day for both the two pupils and the teacher, but the beer was appreciated by all the school (near the school cafeteria, which grumbled over filth ).    Later created Mikkel brewery Mikkeller , which has garnered wide international recognition, while Tobias and Tore moved their production into their parents' basement after they were dropped out of high school. Here they continued to hand brew until in 2010 found that two beers were now ripe to make its first commercial brew.

John Thomas Toohey and his brother James Matthew ran pubs in Melbourne (The Limerick Arms and The Great Britain) before moving to Sydney in the 1860s. They commenced brewing Tooheys Tooheys Black Old Ale in a brewery in the area of present day Darling Harbour. By 1875, demand for their beer had soared and they established The Standard Brewery in inner-city Surry Hills. In 1902, the company went public as Tooheys Limited, and commenced brewing lager (the present day Tooheys New) in 1930. In 1955, the brewery moved west to Lidcombe, where it is currently sited.

This unfocused approach allows Track 7 to experiment with all varieties of beer, regardless of American, Belgian, English, or German inspiration.","http://track7brewing.com/","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","3747 W.

"nZiBpf","Trim Tab Brewing","We craft beers of balance and celebrate the small, unassuming sources that create large-scale positive change - the trim tab. Boom.     Whats a trim tab you say? Look no further than the words of a genius published in a 1972 Playboy.....    “Something hit me very hard once, thinking about what one little man could do. Think of the Queen Mary [an ocean liner]— the whole ship goes by and then comes the rudder. And there's a tiny thing at the edge of the rudder called a trim tab. It's a miniature rudder. Just moving the little trim tab builds a low pressure that pulls the rudder around. Takes almost no effort at all. So I said that the little individual can be a trim tab. Society thinks it's going right by you, that it's left you all together. But if you're doing dynamic things mentally, the fact is that you can just put your foot out like that and the whole big ship of state is going to go. So I said, call me Trim Tab.”   – Buckminster Fuller (Playboy, February 1972)    Small actions - Huge positive impact. We champion that concept and the ways it occurs throughout our world, through each of us. We are proud to call ourselves Alabama brewers. We are Trim Tab Brewing.","http://trimtabbrewing.com/","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-09-29 16:11:51","2721 5th Ave S","Birmingham","AL","35233","+1 (828) 545-4746","Tue:  4:00pm - 10:00pm Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm Thu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm Fri:  3:00pm - 11:00pm Sat:  1:00pm - 11:00pm Sun:  2:00pm - 8:00pm  ","33.5128672","-86.7914959","N","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Pa70RL/upload_pGHkii-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Pa70RL/upload_pGHkii-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Pa70RL/upload_pGHkii-large.png","","","2013","","",""

"C6iHOv","Tröegs Brewing Company","Tröegs Brewing Company was established in 1997 by brothers Chris and John Trogner. Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tröegs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale).     In addition to these beers, Tröegs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery.     In late 2013, Tröegs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tröegs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tröegs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works.     The Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tröegs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others.     Tröegs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tröegs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.    Our state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews.     Our Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef’s specials.    www.troegs.com","http://www.troegs.com/","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-10-02 18:04:49","200 E Hersheypark Dr","Hershey","Pennsylvania","17033","717-232-1297","Sun:  11:00am - 9:00pm Thu:  11:00am - 10:00pm Fri:  11:00am - 10:00pm Sat:  11:00am - 10:00pm  General Store Hours  ------------------------------  Sunday: 11am to 5pm  Monday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","40.2972852","-76.6428527","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n5QFi2/upload_3yONkx-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n5QFi2/upload_3yONkx-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n5QFi2/upload_3yONkx-large.png","","1997","1997","http://www.troegs.com/about_us/newsletter.aspx","",""

"SsYPgS","Tuppers' Hop Pocket Brewing Company","An interest in history and beer led Bob and Ellie Tupper to  a quest throughout the United States and Europe to talk to brewers and sample classic examples of traditional brewing styles.  In 1978 they began taking formal tasting notes on each new beer they could find.    By the early 1990s the Tuppers had tasted and evaluated over 6,000 beers and visited hundreds of breweries.  They had found many excellent beers, but envisioned an ale that no one had made—one that would encompass bold American flavors and traditional European brewing techniques.  They asked Old Dominion Brewing Co., which they felt was one of the very best craft breweries in the country, to work with them to develop this ideal ale.  Tuppers’ Hop Pocket Ale was the result.      In 1997 the Tuppers again worked with the Old Dominion brewers to create Tuppers’ Hop Pocket Pils, based on the Keller or Hefe Pils style of Northern Bavaria, but with a unique American boldness to the flavor.    The Tuppers live in Bethesda, Maryland, where Bob teaches history.  Ellie works in Washington as a production editor of scientific books.  The Tuppers still travel and taste beers and now have notes on over 14,000 different brews.","http://tuppersbeers.com/","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","6404 Redwing Road","Bethesda","Maryland","20817","301-229-2027","","38.973459","-77.127249","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7JTum5/upload_qUmoG7-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7JTum5/upload_qUmoG7-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/7JTum5/upload_qUmoG7-large.png","","","","","",""

Starting with a student exchange to Germany when he was 16, he has dedicated his life to the pursuit of good beer. This brewpub is the result of over 23 years of ""market research"" in hundreds of bars, brewpubs, breweries, garages, and beer festivals all over the world.    The name "" Turtle Mountain"" comes from the Tewa name for Sandia Peak. Alfonso Ortiz (Nico's father) was born and raised at Oke Owingeh, north of Espanola, and one of six Pueblos that speak Tewa. Nico's father's Indian name was ""Oku Pin"", which translates as "" Turtle Mountain"". As a tribute to his father, who provided the inspirational and financial means to open the pub, Nico has named it Turtle Mountain Brewing Company.","http://www.turtlemountainbrewing.com/","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","905 36th Place SE","Rio Rancho","New Mexico","87124","505-994-9497","","35.242565","-106.664416","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/emd8iK/upload_WFiEor-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/emd8iK/upload_WFiEor-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/emd8iK/upload_WFiEor-large.png","","1999","1999","","",""

"AQE3Sx","Twelve Rounds Brewing Company","Our passion for great brews and great food both began in the kitchen. Dan started brewing around 1990, using extracts. He took up the hobby in earnest which meant taking over the garage 5 years ago and transitioning to all-grain brewing. Both Dan and Elle love to cook and brewing days became a natural outlet for hosting all days BBQs with family and friends. The 5-gallon kettle over the kitchen stove grew to a half-barrel, propane-fueled brew rig. And the backyard gained a pellet-smoker alongside the Weber grill. That’s what we call going the distance with brewing and charcuterie!    With family and friends raving about our creation, it’s time to take it seriously. We entered the 2011 California State Fair and won three medals including first place for our Knock-Out Stout and second place for The Contender – our Pale Ale. The following year we won first place for our Scottish Ale which we plan on featuring as one of our seasonal brews.    In early 2012 we decided to pursue opening our own microbrewery. Our first challenge seemed almost insurmountable: finding a name! We hit trademark snags with our first three names and finally scored with Twelve Rounds.","http://www.twelveroundsbrewing.com/","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","866 57th St.","Sacramento","California","95819","(916) 500-1059","","38.566033","-121.433545","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hLGKwV/upload_n6jGiw-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hLGKwV/upload_n6jGiw-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hLGKwV/upload_n6jGiw-large.png","","2012","2012","","",""

"1k3h3N","Twin Lakes Brewing Company","In 1985, while attending the University of California at Berkeley, Samuel Hobbs wrote a chemistry paper, for a laugh, on “aqueous beer foam” (the head of a beer). It would take 21 years for that initial interest to manifest itself into something drinkable. The spark would come after 9/11 while he drank homebrewed stout with five of his friends. Motivated by patriotic feelings and the American dream of creating a business, the energy was set in motion to start Twin Lakes Brewing Company. Weeks later, Sam and his longtime friends Matt Day, Jack Wick, and Mark Fesche developed a unique 15 gallon gravity fed pilot system and began working to create their first signature brews.    They decided to locate the brewery at the beautiful “Twin Lakes Farm” in Greenville, Delaware. This historic 252 acre farm has been in Sam’s family for seven generations and has a deep rock well aquifer which supplies perfect water for brewing. Local artisans converted an old tractor barn and art studio to accommodate a five vessel, gravity fed brewery and tasting room. Finally, on April 13, 2006, the first two brands, Greenville Pale Ale and Route 52 Pilsner, were launched.     Today Twin Lakes Brewery also produces Tweed’s Tavern Stout, Caesar Rodney Golden Ale and Winterthur Wheat, as well as seasonal styles Oktoberfest and Jublicious. Currently, Twin Lakes beer is available on tap at many fine restaurants and taverns in Delaware and Southeastern Pennsylvania. Growlers (half gallon jugs of beer) can be purchased at the brewery and kegs are available at most regional beer and liquor stores.","http://twinlakesbrewingcompany.com/","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","4210 Kennett Pike","Greenville","Delaware","19807","302-658-1826","","39.785885","-75.602527","Y","N","N","Y","brewpub","Brewpub","US","United States","USA","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VcP5iA/upload_AT5fnN-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VcP5iA/upload_AT5fnN-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/VcP5iA/upload_AT5fnN-large.png","","2006","2006","","",""

After returning to the states, they had trouble finding that type of beer in Chicago so they opened Two Brothers Brewing Company in 1996. To get them started, the brothers' grandfather, a retired dairy farmer, donated his bulk milk tanks, which were quickly converted to fermenters. Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including the Project Opus Sour series. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare. In 2011, the Ebel brothers purchased Walter Payton's Roundhouse located in Aurora, IL. The Two Brothers Roundhouse is a full service brewpub restaurant, music venue, offers banquet space for large parties and weddings and hosts the Two Brothers Cafe and Beer Bar!     Two Brothers Brewing Company's award winning products are currently available in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Florida, New York, Iowa and Missouri.","http://www.twobrotherstaphouse.com/","N","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","30w315 Calumet Ave.","Warrenville","Illinois","60555","630-393-BEER","Monday        3:00 - 11:00  Tuesday        3:00 - 11:00  Wednesday   3:00 - 11:00  Thursday      3:00 - 11:00  Friday         12:00 - 12:00  Saturday     12:00 - 12:00  Sunday        12:00 - 9:00","41.824906","-88.211221","N","N","N","Y","brewpub","Brewpub","US","United States","USA","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Cu5xXG/upload_1Io9ak-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Cu5xXG/upload_1Io9ak-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Cu5xXG/upload_1Io9ak-large.png","","1996","1996","","",""

Since Bear was an active dog and on the go, he wanted to create a place where he and his friends could “Come, Sit And Stay”.        Well Uncle Bears’ Brewhouse Grill is that place. Born out of Bear’s  love for craft beer and excellent food, we have created an upbeat, fun atmosphere where friends, family and co-workers can come to enjoy a variety of delicious menu selections & NOW our own locally brewed craft beer. The Uncle Bear’s Brewhouse opened in 2013, as well as the 4 Grill and Bar locations were re-branded to the Grill and Tap concept that same year.    On the menu, whenever you see Bear’s paw print  you can be assured the item is a long-term house favorite or a new favorite we are sure Bear would have loved. Try any one of the items from the “Famous” Sliders, Backyard Burgers and Birds, Big Plates and Serious Sizzles, Gourmet Pizza, Bear “Bites” or Wing selections and you are in for a true treat.        The unique motif has been designed to resemble all of the places Bear or your family dog would hang out such as the garage, backyard or home.

In 1986, Schirf opened the first brewery in the resort town of Park City and named his beers after the majestic Wasatch Mountains that rise just east of Salt Lake City. In July 1989, Schirf Brewing opened its new company headquarters and the first brew pub in Utah at the top of historic Main Street in Park City.    In fact, it was Schirf who proposed the bill to the Utah Legislature in 1988 that would make brew pubs legal in Utah.

But what began as a light hobby soon developed into a deep passion. They quickly outgrew the offerings of U-Brew and expanded their operation into a homebrew setup. Fifteen years later, the two Mikes have a lot of batches, awards, and experience under their belts. Starting in May of 2008, Vertigo Brewing was christened a fully-licensed brewery in a Hillsboro warehouse.   Vertigo Brewing is currently operating a one barrel system, producing eight to ten barrels a month.

Wachusett Country Ale was introduced to beer fans of Massachusetts the next year after lots of experimenting to get the formula just right. When Wachusett opened, the three designed and built most of the equipment; did the brewing and filling, selling and delivering, and everything else that a small startup brewery needed. Ned, Kevin and Peter are now backed by some of the most passionate and capable co-workers in the industry.

"beRdlK","Wayward Brewing","The Wayward Brewing Company is a new craft brewery that is currently being established in the once grungy, but now trendy, inner-west part of Sydney Australia.    Our philosophy is all about brewing great beers that don't always fit with traditional styles. Someone once said that Wayward meant ""being lost, but on purpose"".    We might not have our own brewery space (yet), but all of our beers are created by us and we take 100% responsibility for the product that ends up in your glass.    We happily admit that we are beer geeks, but we’re definitely not trying to prove we are more clever than the next brewer by designing the wackiest beer that only our fellow beer geeks will appreciate.

This made it impossible for microbreweries or small brewpubs to exist. In 1985 Uli Bennewitz went to his local senator and together they passed a bill allowing microbreweries to sell their own beer on site. A year later on the July 4th, 1986 the Weeping Radish Brewery opened for business.      Raised in a small village in Bavaria, Uli was determined to bring the high quality beer he was used to across the ocean to North Carolina. A Master Brewer came over from Germany and brewed the first batches of Corolla Gold, Fest, and Black Radish. Strictly adhering to the Reinheitsgebot Purity Law of 1516, all Weeping Radish beers are brewed using hops, malt, yeast and water â€“ no additives, chemicals or preservatives.      Our beer list has expanded over the years and currently on draft in the pub we have the OBX KÃ¶lsch, IPA 25, and Radler as well as our original Corolla Gold, Fest and Black Radish.

The brewery was founded in 1436 when the brothers Schorer acquired the rights to brew and open a tavern. After establishing property for bottling they soon began brewing on what would become the foundations of the Wernesgrüner Pils Legend. It is known as the aforementioned Pils Legend, because it was a bitter specialty during the communist period in Germany. [1] Throughout the company's history it has endured numerous changes of ownership. In 1762 the Günnel family bought the Schorer brewery. In 1774 the Männel family took over the bottling properties. Even though at the end of the 19th century the label now had five independent breweries, the families were still competing with each other. By 1910 the company had established itself throughout Germany and the Netherlands, and was even served on the renowned Hapag-Lloyd ships that ran from Hamburg to America.[1] The company was acquired by the Bitburger Braugruppe GmbH in 2002.

Popular tastes in beer have changed and matured, as have the brewing process and ingredients. We have chosen to develop extremely high quality, natural beers that will be popular with the sophisticated customers of our time and in our community. We utilized the same process to roll out other Lithia Premium Beers such as Bucky Blonde Ale, arguably the most complex, richest blonde beer ever brewed.    Most importantly, Lithia Beer will again, and exclusively, be based in West Bend & Washington County, where it belongs. It’s heritage will now continue to benefit our community for hopefully, the next hundred years.

"wbpj5b","Pipeworks Brewing Company","Pipeworks began, as many breweries do, in the stove top kettles and plastic-bucket fermenters of the home brewer. Beejay Oslon and Gerrit Lewis met while working at Chicago's famous West Lakeview Liquors, a haven for beer geeks in search of new and exciting brews from around the world. While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.     The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.     Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.

"8C6fp0","Pivovarna Laško","The historical beginnings of Pivovarna Laško reach back to 1825, when the mead and gingerbread maker Franz Geyer set up a brewery in the former Valvasor Hospital, which still stands today. One hundred and eighty five years have passed since then, with Pivovarna Laško growing from a local brewery to the leading producer of beer and together with other companies in the Group, into the leading producer of mineral and natural waters, non-alcoholic beverages and other beverages on the Slovene market.    Beverages production belongs to the more competitive industries, where multinational corporations, commercial companies and demanding users play the most important roles.    Pivovarna Laško and the Laško Group are embarking on a path of development with the following basic business orientation: to produce and sell innovative trendy products, maintain the market position of its own brand names on the domestic market and to attain again and expand positions in foreign markets achieved in the past.  Furthermore, to use the most advanced technology in the development of appropriate production and commercial programs which guarantee the top quality of beer, non-alcoholic beverages and mineral and natural water.    The umbrella brand Laško is represented by the following products: the Laško Zlatorog, the special beers Laško Club, Laško Dark, and Laško Light,  the light beer Export Pils and the sweet beverage Laško Malt with apple and peach flavours. In addition to the above brands Pivovarna Laško also produces the Bandidos product line, a beer with added aromas and in three different flavours: Bandidos Tequila, Bandidos Ice and Bandidos Sun. The Bandidos brand image was entirely renewed in spring 2010 to get even closer to its target population.    For special occasions Pivovarna Laško brews unique beers, such as the Jubilejnik and Eliksir beers. Pivovarna Laško entered an entirely new field in 2010, when it launched on the Slovenian market a novelty in the category of beverages, namely the apple cider, under the brand name iC Cider.      Despite the harsh market conditions Pivovarna Laško, d. d. maintained its position of leading beer producer in Slovenia.    The Pivovarna Laško Group today includes producers of beer, mineral, spring and natural waters, non-alcoholic beverages, spirits and other alcoholic drinks, and syrups for the productions of drinks, and also a newspaper and publishing activity.","http://www.pivo-lasko.si/","1825","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jNvzFs/upload_jdgLWU-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jNvzFs/upload_jdgLWU-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jNvzFs/upload_jdgLWU-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Trubarjeva ulica 28","Laško","","`````","+386 3 734 80 00","","50.593349","23.23594","Y","N","N","Y","production","Production Facility","SI","","Slovenia","SVN","705","","",""

"DrFlD0","Carlsbad","Back in March of 1987 Gina and Vince Marsaglia, a pair of siblings in their 20′s, bought a struggling pizza place in the sleepy coastal town of Solana Beach, just north of San Diego. From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the “Pizza Port” with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own “San Diego” twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach    The parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge décor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn’t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite.     Early on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant’s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992.     Embracing the same “flavor-driven” principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego’s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival “Small Brewpub of the Year”.     The Pizza Port family’s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named “Large Brewpub of the Year”.","http://www.pizzaport.com/locations/carlsbad/","1987","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QSVVxD/upload_Yqeh6Z-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QSVVxD/upload_Yqeh6Z-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QSVVxD/upload_Yqeh6Z-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","571 Carlsbad Village Dr.","Carlsbad","California","92008","760-720-7007","","33.1596505","-117.3478111","N","N","N","Y","brewpub","Brewpub","US","1997","United States","USA","","","",""

People met in pubs to share stories, news, ideas, and company over their pints. Today’s craft brewing industry is increasingly local, providing a chance to renew the community gathering role that pubs played in our past.     To that end, we are using local talent in every aspect of our business, from spent grain to art to tap handles to logo and t-shirt design; we will also make every effort to promote other local breweries and businesses.    We will focus on producing small batches of technically-great, full-flavored ales that infuse pleasurable twists into classic styles… and sometimes blow style guidelines out of the water. It is also our intention to serve 4-5 categories of beer (I/IPA, Hoppy, Belgian, Malty, and Seasonal taps) but to continually rotate the specific beers served in each category so that we provide a new drinking pleasure on almost every visit.    At Pleasure House Brewing, we thrive on the idea of staying connected to the people who drink our beer!","http://www.pleasurehousebrewing.com","2014","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/tciJOF/upload_IbPhW0-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/tciJOF/upload_IbPhW0-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/tciJOF/upload_IbPhW0-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","3025 Shore Drive","Virginia Beach","Virginia","23451","(757) 647-8597","Thu: 4:00 pm - 9:00 pm  Fri: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm  Sat: 12:00 pm - 10:00 pm  Sun: 12:00 pm - 8:00 pm","36.909833","-76.078121","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","2014","United States","USA","","","",""

In fact, that was what June was doing in the kitchen when we got there. I had their delicious burger served with regular or sweet potato fries and Dale and Jan shared a pizza. What makes their pizza unique is that it has no sauce. According to June ""Sauce can over power the pizza, the true flavor is in the dough and the 100% whole milk Wisconsin cheese. The Gardinara pizza is fresh cut vegetables marinated in oils and spices with a bed of provolone cheese. We made pizza every day for three weeks and found provolone to be the tastiest cheese for the Gardinara pizza.” Pepperoni or sweet Italian sausage can be added as well as a variety of veggies. Mozzarella and cheddar cheese are used on other pizzas.    On the menu they also have hot dogs, chicken wings, and sandwiches including the kid popular grilled cheese sandwich.

The brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.

"HeStKS","Potosi Brewing Company","Founded in 1852 by Gabriel Hail and John Albrecht, the Potosi Brewery began as a small brewery quenching the thirsts of area farmers, fishermen and miners. In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.    The restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.    In 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.","http://www.potosibrewery.com/","1852","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_DbScRK-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_DbScRK-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Q4eTmd/upload_DbScRK-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","209 South Main Street","Potosi","Wisconsin","53820","608-763-4002","","42.6716654","-90.7271709","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","1852","United States","USA","","Box 177","",""

"WHuVdK","Prescott Brewing Company","PBC is well-established and highly successful, with a history of annual growth since inception. We foster a team oriented management style. We offer an excellent casual, yet professional, dining experience for our guests, never pretentious, emphasizing ""fun & friendly... brewpub style"" menu selections and service. We are high-volume, fast paced and right in the middle of all the action for the dozens of events that take place right outside our doorstep on Prescott's hometown Courthouse Plaza. We are community minded and involved in many local events and fundraisers. Our kitchen is a 99% scratch kitchen, providing a large & varied menu. Our bar is lively and we attract people of all ages and backgrounds. We are hands-on owners and look for managers with the same philosophy.    We’re also pleased to announce that Prescott Brewing Company, the MICROBREWERY, is now an extension of our brewery operations!  With the introduction of PBC’s Liquid Amber Ale and Ponderosa IPA in cans, we quickly outgrew our little 7-barrel brewhouse that’s been our workhorse since opening in 1994.  So we bit the bullet and built an off-site microbrewery production plant out by the Prescott airport in 2011.  The first 30-barrel batch of Liquid Amber was brewed by John and Lead Brewer, Jan, on December 27th, 2011 and was a true better- late- than- never Christmas gift!  Look for both brands increasingly available throughout Arizona.  And thus the story continues.      PBC celebrated its 20TH ANNIVERSARY downtown Prescott in March of 2014….thanks to our many loyal supporters, locals and visitors alike. 20 years of hard labor...nah, not that bad, but 20 years in the restaurant business is a LONG time!  So, we’ll just keep on keepin’ on and are excited to expand the selection of canned product for distribution as production allows out at the airport location.    YOU are included amongst those who've allowed us to thrive, contribute to our community and keep 65-75 employees on staff all year long! As everyone knows, these have been difficult times for many. We believe every one of us knows personally of someone who has struggled these past few years with job loss, or a small business owner who has had to lay off a good employee, or maybe has had to close their business. Luckily, PBC is okay, thanks to YOU. Not to say we wouldn’t want more of the dining dollars out there...but we’re extremely grateful for the continued support of those in our community and visitors from literally all over the world. We’d like to remind everyone that each of us can make a difference in our communities by shopping local, supporting locally-owned, independent businesses, supporting our local charities and non-profits and volunteering for our favorite causes.

Although a winery, Otway Estate has embraced beer and brewing as much as the love of fine wine.    Blessed with the availability of pure Otway rainwater, we brew all of our beers with this 'gift from the gods'.  It is well known that you need good water to make good beer and there's nothing better than water from the lush rainforest.  The brewery was commissioned in February 2007 with the release of the first two beers took place in March 2007.    At Prickly Moses Handcrafted Beer, we believe that beer is diverse in its colour, aroma and flavour and is not just limited to ""yellow fizzy stuff"".  We create beers to match an appearance, aroma and flavour profile - not a budget - so we use the best possible ingredients we can find.  Our repetoire of exciting beer recipes continuously grows and we're always keen to try something new.    We also believe that food is an important part of the craft beer experience and we're always trying to pair good food with our great beer.

"qVyAhN","Privatbrauerei Erdinger Weissbräu","At the world's largest wheat beer brewery, tradition and progress go hand in hand: our beer is brewed according to traditional recipes, but using state-of-the-art technology. Today, beer connoisseurs in Germany and around the world regard our traditional specialty beers from Erding, Bavaria, as the ultimate in wheat beer enjoyment.    The beginnings of Erdinger Weissbräu date back to 1886, the year in which construction of a wheat beer brewery in Erding was first officially recorded. After several changes in ownership, the General Manager at the time, Franz Brombach, bought the brewery in 1935 and re-named it Erdinger Weissbräu on December 27, 1949.    In 1965, the son of Franz Brombach, Werner Brombach, entered the business. He took over the private brewery in 1975 and still leads his father's successful business today. In addition to a strong emphasis on quality, Werner Brombach focuses above all on a targeted sales and promotion strategy with a clear brand identity, which highlights the values of the old Bavarian beer specialty and its superior quality standards.    Today, Erdinger weissbier stands for wheat beer enjoyment and the Bavarian brewing tradition. The traditional brewery has established itself as the national and international market leader for weissbier. As one of Germany's largest private breweries, Erdinger Weissbräu is among the leaders on the national German beer market.","http://www.erdinger.de","1886","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/m9SH4l/upload_FwusIa-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/m9SH4l/upload_FwusIa-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/m9SH4l/upload_FwusIa-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Franz-Brombach-Strae 1-20","Erding","Bayern","","49-(0)8122-/-4090","","48.31532","11.89111","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","DE","","Germany","DEU","276","","",""

Pub Dog quickly became famous for our gourmet personal-sized thin-crust pizzas, fresh salads, and ""Dog Deal"" beers - 2 mugs of our own house craft beer for one low price all the time.      We developed a loyal late night following by serving food every night until 1:30 and staying open until 2:00AM every night.

"e0v4NA","Public House Brewing Co","In 2010, Josh & Beth Stacy and Josh & Trisha Goodridge--longtime  friends--opened Public House Brewing Company in Rolla, MO, the town's first brewpub.  But it was a long, long time in the works.  Like any business, there were big ups and downs on the road to the first pour and we think that story is worth sharing.  So here goes....     Josh Stacy grew up like any other kid in America, playing music, sports, and sharing his space with two siblings.  Totally normal--with one exception.  His father, Steven Stacy, was an award-winning home brewer.  Steve was brewing world class beers in his kitchen before most people had even heard of the hobby.  Josh grew up thinking every kid helped their dad bottle homemade beer on Saturday mornings before they could watch cartoons.     Fast-forward a few years.  Stacy and Goodridge meet in junior high, become fast friends, and begin playing music together (and have been ever since).  Even more years went by.  Between the two there were graduations, marriages, children, careers, and beer.  Yes, beer.  At some point (memories are fuzzy) Stacy introduced Goodridge to drinking real, full-flavored craft beers.  It wasn't long before he introduced Goodridge to brewing real, full-flavored craft beers.  Goodridge was hooked.      Many weekends were spent in the Stacy home garage milling grain, mashing in, adding hops, and pitching yeast.  The two took in as much of Steve Stacy's brewing knowledge as possible, brewing good beer and having a couple pints throughout the brew day.  That always loosened the tongue.  Next would inevitably come the conversation about taking this hobby to the next level.      Goodridge heard this conversation more times than he can remember.  On a Sunday afternoon while leisurely enjoying a fine craft beer at home with his wife Trisha, he got a wild idea.  Enough was enough, he told her.  He immediately called Stacy and said, ""I'm coming over to your house.""  Goodridge passionately pleaded his case to Josh and Beth.  ""Rolla needs fresh craft beer and we're the guys for the job.""     Josh Stacy wasn't a hard sell as he had always truly wanted to do this, but now they needed help from their wives to make this dream happen.  Thankfully, these wonderful ladies agreed to take the plunge and the four embarked on the treacherous journey together to bring fresh craft beer to Rolla.  Many trials and triumphs later, Public House Brewing Company opened its doors on December 16th, 2010, to a very thirsty populous.     One week later, all the beer they had made was gone.  It was  a hit!  The Rolla area embraced its first and only craft brewpub and put Public House on the map.  Now the Stacys and Goodridges are fulfilling their dream of bringing hand-crafted beers of the highest quality to Mid-Missouri.  You are invited to come in and have a pint with us.  Cheers!     Now that you know our story, we encourage you to come in and share yours. No matter what the occasion, visiting The Public House Brewery is always an extraordinary experience.       The team at Public House looks forward to welcoming you!","http://www.publichousebrewery.com/","2010","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BumlJd/upload_HIxOY2-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BumlJd/upload_HIxOY2-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BumlJd/upload_HIxOY2-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","600 North Rolla Street","Rolla","Missouri","65401","573-426-2337","","37.9484144","-91.7725297","Y","N","N","Y","brewpub","Brewpub","US","","United States","USA","","Suite B","",""

"qZJOHj","Quaff On! Brewing Company","Quaff: To drink heartily and with gusto!    At Quaff ON! Brewing Company, 'Gusto' is part of everything we do. Our hand-crafted beers reflect our passion for the brewer's art and our commitment to creating beers that excite and delight the quaffer's palette.  Quaff ON! Brewing Company was formed in 2012 in response to the demand for the iconic craft beers we developed at Big Woods Brewing Company, our brewpub located in the heart of Brown County Indiana. Why 'Quaff ON!'? Because from the day Big Woods threw open its doors in 2009, Quaff ON! has been the rallying cry, the toast, and the salutation of our loyal fans.  When Big Woods founders Jeff McCabe, Tim O'Bryan and Ed Ryan decided to create Quaff ON! Brewing Company, they had one Master Brewer in mind to take Busted Knuckle Ale, Hare Trigger IPA, Six Foot Blonde and Timid Virgin Pale to new heights and a larger market. That Brewer is Mark Havens, whose reputation as a talented and committed 'creator of craft beers' is well known. Mark came on board in time to lend a hand in the conversion of our 60 year old bowling alley into the Quaff ON! brewing facility.  Once Mark got the new brewery up and running and our original Big Woods recipes were in production, Mark began introducing new beers, including Yellow Dwarf Wheat, a hopped up wheat that begs to be quaffed and Sadie the Goat Brown Ale, a hearty homage to the substantial beers quaffed by river pirates 2 centuries ago.  Currently Quaff ON!'s beers are distributed all over Indiana. Look for us at your favorite watering hole and in the craft beer section at package stores throughout the state. If Quaff ON! is not served at your favorite place, send us a note and we'll get it in there! If you're travelling our way, stop in and see us in Brown County and visit us in Nashville at Big Woods Village where you can enjoy fine craft beer, great food and the best in local entertainment.

"TZFee5","Quest Brewing Company","Quest Brewing Company officially started becoming a reality in January 2012.  That is when Don Richardson and Andrew Watts met for the first time; each with thoughts of opening up a microbrewery in Greenville, SC.  Both had put together plans for their company vision and, as luck would have it, those plans mirrored each other!  The two joined forces and Quest Brewing Company was founded.    Once the business was formed, a brewery name was needed.  After weeks of brainstorming, the name ‘Quest’ rose to the top of our list.  We wanted a name that emulates that passionate and adventurous spirit of the Greenville community.    ”People in Greenville are always on some kind of quest.  Whether it is to bike the entire Swamp Rabbit Trail or hike Table Rock, there is a very adventurous spirit here.  We wanted to embrace that.” -Quest’s Andrew Watts    Quest’s beer is meant to be premium and sought-after, much like a goal or quest.

All of our mead, ciders, dessert mead and braggots-honey ales, are produced using the finest honey available without the addition of added sulfites.    Our braggots are styled after many traditional ales but with a major twist - there is lots of honey added during fermentation. Sometimes up to 50% of the fermentable sugar. In many cases while they are modeled after more traditional styles, they are unique and stand on their own.

All of our beers will be available in our taproom, which is located at the brewery. The taproom will have dartboards, a comfy lounge, and a few TVs for those days when the game is on.

We were born on February 26, 1971 when our founders took their entrepreneurial spirit and experiences they received making pizza and serving beer at Shakey’s Pizza Parlor to open their own restaurant.

Since 1971, the Ram’s primary commitment has been to always provide our guests with superior quality food and gracious hospitality.

In addition to brewing according to the Law of Purity, we decided not to filter or pasteurize our Bavarian Lagers to ensure the vitamins remain whole for that rich, mellow taste. Within months of opening the pub we began selling Red Oak to other accounts in the Greensboro area. In no time the 6 original aging tanks were maxed out so we added on to the building and installed 13 new tanks. By 2001 Red Oaks popularity had grown so much that we were brewing 24/7...and out of aging capacity. We began the search for a location to build a larger brewery with space to accommodate future growth.  After settling on a 12 acre tract along I 40/85 between Greensboro and Burlington in 2003...we began discussions with 3 Bavarian Brewery fabricators. Rolec of Cheming, Bavaria was chosen to supply the new brewery; and in 2005 construction began on the building to house it.  By the summer of 2007 Red Oak was ready to open the nation's most modern computerized brewing facility...consistently producing the Freshest, Purest, Bavarian Lagers in America.","http://www.redoakbrewery.com/","1991","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hNPjUO/upload_pgA6o0-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hNPjUO/upload_pgA6o0-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hNPjUO/upload_pgA6o0-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","6901 Konica Drive","Whitsett","North Carolina","27377","888-Red-Oaks","Brewery Tours are every Friday at 3:00 pm (21 and up only).

"vbKhpV","Redstone Meadery","David Myers, known as 'Chairman of the Mead', founder of Redstone Meadery, is a romantic and wants to see mead once again enjoying the glory days of yesteryear. He started the Boulder, Colorado company with the 'natural philosophy' that he produce the highest quality honey wine on the market.    Because of this 'philosophy of mead', Redstone does not cork (to avoid oxidation) but instead uses swing top bottles. This ensures the mead will not breathe while cellaring plus offers a much longer shelf life once the bottle has been opened.    In keeping with the 'natural' approach, Redstone does not add any sulfites, a known allergen, as honey is it's own natural preservative. Redstone only pasteurizes the must (unfermented mead) and never boils. The company strives to feature the flavors of the fermentable as much as possible.    In 2003 Redstone Meadery brought the International Mead Festival (www.meadfest.com) to Boulder, Colorado and with that helped to establish mead as its own beverage category. Also at this time Redstone spearheaded the creation of the International Mead Association (www.meadfest.org) to help promote and educate the masses about the world's first fermented beverage.    Currently, Redstone products are distributed to 20 states across the U.S., making it the widest distributed wine from the state of Colorado and one of the most widely distributed meads in the country!

"6mYnLr","Reuben's Brews","We are a small family ran brewery in the Ballard district of Seattle, crafting tasty small batch brews.    Our story by grace!    Although only a month old at the time, our clever, thoughtful son, Reuben, came up with the idea of giving Adam a homebrewing kit for his birthday.  When Reuben and I took Adam to Bob’s (our friendly, neighborhood homebrew supply store) to pick up his kit, I was expecting to pick up a little tin of “beer mix” and a bucket to brew.  We were a bit surprised and overwhelmed by the seriousness of this beer-brewing business.  I thought, “Oh great, there’s more storage space gone once Adam gives up on this little hobby in a month’s time.”  Even though I rarely admit to being wrong now that we’re married, I couldn’t have been farther from the mark thinking that this would be an easily discarded hobby.  The first brewing system has been dwarfed by the upgraded and supersized brewhouse, and there has been no chance for the mash tun, brew kettle, or hot liquor tank to gather any dust!  Adam’s hobby turned into full-blown obsession, and in tribute to the little man who started it all, Reuben’s Brews was born!","http://www.reubensbrews.com","2011","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n2527g/upload_wIJHWr-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n2527g/upload_wIJHWr-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/n2527g/upload_wIJHWr-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","1406 NW 53rd Street","Seattle","Washington","98107","","","47.6673244","-122.3741648","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","2011","United States","USA","","Suite 1A","","http://www.reubensbrews.com/contact/"

"202T0m","Rhinegeist","Rhinegeist is a brewery out of Cincinnati, OH that was built within the skeleton of the old Moerlein bottling plant (built in 1895). Within these unique and historic walls, we brew 20bbl batches of beer that sings with flavor and delights us. The yin/yang of our brewing philosophy is hoppy/sessionable and we aim to brew beers where “the first sip calls for the third”.  We’re a small team with big dreams and tend to smile while we sweat. We brew those styles which are most compelling to our thirst and we certainly hope you enjoy our brews as much as we do.    Rhinegeist means “ghost of the Rhine”, and refers to our place here in the historic Brewery District in the Over the Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati. At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.    We self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account. Fresh beer is tasty beer, and that’s our favorite kind.","http://rhinegeist.com/","2013","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0s8yID/upload_aOpehU-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0s8yID/upload_aOpehU-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0s8yID/upload_aOpehU-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","1910 Elm St","Cincinnati","Ohio","45202","(513) 381-1356","Thursday 4pm - 11pm  Friday 4pm - 12am  Saturday 12pm - 12am  Sunday 12pm - 7pm","39.1168193","-84.5201739","Y","N","N","Y","tasting","Tasting Room","US","2013","United States","USA","","","",""

As with all other trappist breweries, the beer is only sold in order to financially support the monastery and some other good causes. The monks will not increase production based on demand or profit motives, but only enough to support themselves, resulting in a fairly limited supply of beer availability.

"yYIiyy","Rock Art Brewery","Matt began the brewery in the basement of our home in 1997. Wow! I can't believe I let him do that! His first beer was Whitetail Ale. A nice crisp refreshing golden ale. I was really enjoying wheat beers at the time. I guess that's why I let him start Rock Art! The Brewery was ready to leave home and move to it's own place down the road in Morrisville, VT in 2001. We are still located there and now have a terrific space for people to come and visit. Come on by and say hello!    Our Mission is to offer our friends and family a wonderful beer at the end of the day!","http://www.rockartbrewery.com/","1997","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LpX3cU/upload_GoA424-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LpX3cU/upload_GoA424-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LpX3cU/upload_GoA424-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","632 Laporte Road Route 100","Morrisville","Vermont","05661","802-888-9400","9:00 until 6:00 Monday-Saturday    TOURS: We have a wonderful viewing area upstairs and are happy to bring people up for a tour at 2:00 & 4:00 daily with a special tour at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday.

"m3Fcel","Rogue Ales","Rogue Ales was founded in 1988 by Jack Joyce, Rob Strasser and Bob Woodell, three corporate types who wanted to go into the food/beverage industry. Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence.

"TxaTZN","Rooster Fish Brewing","Roosterfish Brewing’s history begins in 1990 when the Wildflower Café was founded by owner Doug Thayer.  A microbrewery was in the original plans for the business but was not feasible at the time due to the high cost of equipment and space.  The Wildflower Café had enormous success, which helped the inspiration for the Crooked Rooster Brewpub’s opening in 1998, again founded by Doug Thayer.  Throughout the running of these side-by-side businesses, Doug always had brewing on his mind and began to experiment in 2002 with home brewing.  Receiving excellent feedback on his brews from several beer aficionados, Roosterfish Brewing’s first official beer, Black Walnut Nut Brown Ale (now known as Original Nut Brown Ale) was unveiled at the Crooked Rooster and Wildflower Café in 2004.  This was shortly followed with the Butternut Pale Ale, now known as Dog Tooth Pale Ale.  The drastic name changes occurred because the originals were rejected due to “implied ingredients” that weren’t actually present in the beers.","http://www.roosterfishbrewing.com/","1990","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WQyasy/upload_XoXYMd-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WQyasy/upload_XoXYMd-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WQyasy/upload_XoXYMd-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","223 - 301 North Franklin Street","Watkins Glen","New York","14891","607-535-9797","Mon - Sun: 11:30 am - 12:30 am","42.381121","-76.874257","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","1990","United States","USA","","","",""

"N39Q0L","Rubicon Brewing Company","For 22 years, the Rubicon Brewing Company has been a jewel of a capital city culture. It’s not just because of the award-winning fine ales and great food served up by the Rubicon. Within the past four years, under the auspices of owner Glynn Phillips, the Rubicon has become renowned for its community outreach and philanthropic efforts. It’s support for Sacramento kids and various people in need that has transformed the Rubicon into a vital cog of Sacramento life.    “This pub is part of the community, and I don’t just mean geographically,” said Glynn Phillips, owner of the Rubicon since June 2005. “It’s important for us to give back as much as we can to show our appreciation. I really feel like we’re connected with the people and that they can trust that they’ll feel at home here.”    Brewmaster Scott Cramlet has felt so at home that he’s stayed more than two decades. In October 2006, he experienced a thrill very few craft brewers achieve in their careers: stepping on stage to receive a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival. Cramlet won for his Winter Wheatwine, and followed that achievement with a silver GABF medal in 2009. In the craft brewing industry, consistent victories in the respected blind-panel tasting contest bring international acclaim.    “We’ve gone through so many different phases during my time here, but we’re very happy with things right now,” he said. “There is a lot of hope for future and expanding our business. We hope to double our capacity and get more of our products in bottles and more of a market presence -- not too huge but bigger than we are now. I’m certainly very proud to work for a place that has been around so long and has its place in history. We are not the new kid on street. I tell people how long I’ve been at the Rubicon, and I hear people say, ‘Wow, that’s impressive.’”    In some ways, the transition from founder Ed Brown to Phillips was more than a decade in the making. Brown had known Phillips since the 1970s as the good friend of Brown’s nephews in the Bay Area town of Moraga. As Phillips paid his dues in the craft brewing industry – first at Great Basin Brewing in Sparks, Nev., and next at Marin Brewing in Larkspur – Phillips kept in close contact with Brown. Buoyed by his management experience at Marin Brewing, Phillips was confident that he could handle the passing of the baton at the Rubicon.","http://www.rubiconbrewing.com/","1987","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iBzEfC/upload_9rcK7S-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iBzEfC/upload_9rcK7S-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/iBzEfC/upload_9rcK7S-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","2004 Capitol Avenue","Sacramento","California","95814","916-448-7032","Monday - Thrusday: 11am to 11:30pm  Friday & Saturday: 11am to 12:30am  Sunday: 11am to 10pm","38.573116","-121.480958","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","1987","United States","USA","","","",""

"hHD54O","Rush River Brewing","Rush River Brewing Company  in River Falls, WI provides locally brewed ales throughout Wisconsin and Minnesota. Owner/Brewers Nick Anderson and Dan Chang started the company in 2004 with the help of a third partner, Robbie Stair after relocating to Minneapolis from Seattle. Robbie owned a farm in scenic Maiden Rock, WI just above the confluence of the Rush River and Lake Pepin. After converting a pole barn into a fully functioning brewery, the trio produced a limited quantity of draft-only beers while steadily building a reputation  for brewing high quality ales. After two and a half years of growth, it became evident that bottled beer was the next move to be made. Luckily, the town of River Falls, WI came to the table with an offer to build a custom building for a brand new brewery. In 2007, the new facility opened its doors with the addition of a refurbished bottling line, and additional fermenters. The new Rush River brewery was now poised to increase production and distributorship. We now have ten distributors in two states and produce nine brands including seasonals. Our small size still allows us to experiment with new styles, while the larger capacity for brewing and storage keep our regular brands flowing out the door.","http://www.rushriverbeer.com","2004","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wpQqy4/upload_seaXqD-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wpQqy4/upload_seaXqD-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wpQqy4/upload_seaXqD-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","990 Antler Court","River Falls","Wisconsin","54022","1-715-426-2054","","44.8902357","-92.6377675","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","","United States","USA","","","",""

See the city life didn’t do it, neighbor’s too close or just plain freedom of the country, Something got us seeking a different path? We moved out from the Capital city to our new Beaver dam address, 30 acres with an old barn and a pond near here is home and home is good. Wouldn’t trade it for another pond anywhere! Peaceful country living, it feeds the soul, drink some in as you spend a little time with us.     We got busy, raised the little ones up, built a business and worked hard on the old homestead remembering to be grateful each day for the life we have carved out. What a long strange trip it has been so far! We have learned ambition and hard work get you where you want to go, it just takes some time and a lot of patience!     Austin and I Started brewing several years ago, we loved cooking together and drinking too so it was a natural progression. Brewing and sharing with friends our fresh all grain brews became an obsession for us. Our passion is to brew great local beers by sourcing the finest quality ingredients available and creating craft recipes that highlight the best qualities of those ingredients.

Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana.

Our small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.    We brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.    Our first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).    Please visit us if you are in Houston.

They made batches at home for themselves, their friends, for weddings, parties, etc..  and realized this is what they wanted to do for a job.   Jeff apprenticed with a professional brewer (local celebrity Skip Madsen of Pike, Boundary Bay, American, etc…) and learned the pro angle of the trade.   They have seen the evolution, gone through it, appreciate it, and are happy to be where they are today.    Salish Sea Brewing Co. is a 10 bbl (310 gallon per batch) establishment.  We hope to brew twice a week, offering a variety of ales and the occasional lager and pilsner.     Jeff and Erika have a  6-year-old little girl and a 2-year-old son.  They are family oriented and hope for the brewery to be family approachable.   Families are welcome, but this is a brewery with a tasting room, not a playground (we do not cater to children).  Please respect our space and the space of others.  Minors must be accompanied by an adult.     Our roots are solid, our goals are lofty, but our dreams, aspirations, and hopes are high.  We want to create a place to showpiece our beers, invite your friends and families, and for you all to have a great time.    The Salish Sea Brewing Company is the real deal!    We have three 10bbl fermenters in place, the 10bbl bright tank, kettle, and mash up and running!  Please join us for a beer soon.","http://salishbrewing.com","","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/s2QjsH/upload_KihU2P-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/s2QjsH/upload_KihU2P-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/s2QjsH/upload_KihU2P-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-09-24 13:41:23","518 Dayton Street","Edmonds","Washington","98020","425-582-8474","Wed:  3:00pm - 10:00pm Thu:  3:00pm - 10:00pm Fri:  12:00pm - 11:00pm Sat:  12:00pm - 11:00pm Sun:  12:00pm - 8:00pm  Closed on Mondays.","47.8096929","-122.3767578","Y","N","N","Y","tasting","Tasting Room","US","","United States","USA","","Suite 104","",""

"TSKxwK","Sand Creek Brewing Company","The Sand Creek Brewing Company began on a dairy farm in Downing, Wisconsin, about 20 miles northwest of the city of Menomonie. After homebrewing on the family farm for years, brewmaster Cory Schroeder teamed up with Jim Wiesender to found the brewery in 1999.    Using equipment scrounged from various industries, such as a converted pudding tank for the brew kettle, the pair launched a successful business, brewing the beer just steps away from the chicken coop and a busy dairy farm.    Their Sand Creek Golden Ale and English Style Special Ale, available only on draft and in half-gallon growlers, soon developed a reputation throughout Wisconsin's many brew fests. With a capacity of only about 150 barrels per year, the brewery, now with a third owner on board, quickly outgrew the little farm shed converted into a brewhouse.    Hoping to remain in the Dunn/St. Croix counties area, the company looked for a suitable place to relocate, but came up empty handed. Then opportunity knocked in the form of a phone call one evening from their friend in Black River Falls, Pioneer brewmaster Todd Krueger. The brewery was for sale.    In March of 2004 the combined forces of the two breweries officially formed the new Sand Creek Brewing Co. of Black River Falls, Wisconsin.","http://www.sandcreekbrewing.com/","1999","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gsADrL/upload_29jbgo-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gsADrL/upload_29jbgo-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gsADrL/upload_29jbgo-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","320 Pierce St","Black River Falls","Wisconsin","54615","(715) 284-7553","","44.2928569","-90.8510691","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","","United States","USA","","","",""

By the end of 19th century, production at the Sarajevo brewery reached 22000 hl, prior the First World War production was at 116000 hl and in 1916 – it has climbed to 150000 hl. From 1965 to 1980, Sarajevo brewery has recorded a steady growth that dropped in period from 1980 to 1984.    I took over the Sarajevo brewery leadership in 1984. Steady growth during the following years reached from 299000 hl to 784000 hl in 1991. Agression on Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995 did not haltered the production and our natural water wells provided much needed clean water for the Sarajevo population. Latest war created damages to Sarajevo brewery esteemated 20 million dollars.    From 1995 to 2009, Sarajevo brewery strategic focus was to rebuild damages and to modernize company for what we invested over 80 million Euros. Today, Sarajevo brewery uses most modern technology combined with untouched traditional roots of water quality and tehnological processes.

In 2002, we signed an agreement with PepsiCo producing lines of refreshing and nonalcoholic drinks from Pepsi's program.    Today, Sarajevo brewery production has climbed significantly producing 800000 hl of beer and 1.000 000 hl of nonalcoholic and refreshing beverages per year.

"jmyqSv","Scars & Stripes Brewing Company","The name really says it all. Four Army veterans got together one day to brew beer and talk about movies, music, video games, and life which then turned into a regular home brewing event. Not too long afterwards, it was noticed that the city of Waco, Texas didn't have a microbrewery to call its own to accommodate a growing music scene and its relaxed college atmosphere. It only seemed obvious what the next move would be.    Even though the brew-masters and owners are Army Veterans, the name Scars & Stripes stands as tribute all military veterans as a thank you for the sacrificing that has been done so everyone can live free. The mentality behind this company is not your Captain America patriotism, but rather one that embraces Independence and freedom for all with no judgement for lifestyle choices.    We will be Waco's only micro brewery! Our beer will be self distributed around various stores and restaurants in the Central and Northern Texas area but we will also have regular taste testings for anyone who is of legal drinking age to take a tour of the brewing facility and to get a free try of the craft beer we are creating. Shirts, glasses, stickers, and growlers will be available for purchase.","http://scarsstripesbrewco.com/","2012","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eOIJn2/upload_LiPXh7-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eOIJn2/upload_LiPXh7-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eOIJn2/upload_LiPXh7-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","323 N Industrail","Waco","Texas","76710","","","31.524351","-97.180459","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","2012","United States","USA","","Suite L","",""

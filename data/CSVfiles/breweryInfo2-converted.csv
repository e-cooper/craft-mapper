The first batch of Berghoff beer was brewed in Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1887 by Herman Berghoff and his three brothers. Herman’s desire to expand the market for the family’s beer led him to sell the product at the Chicago World’s Fair where it received high acclaim. Since then, Berghoff has continued its success and relevance in the Chicago market and beyond.                  As the craft beer market has evolved, the brand has received fresh, exciting updates. Berghoff changed its brewing location and is now proudly brewed at Point Brewery in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Berghoff has also refreshed itself with updated recipes and packaging. With consulting from brewing experts Randy Mosher and John Hannafan, Berghoff’s new, top-notch beers are ready to satisfy consumer demand. As the brewery looks to the future, Berghoff beer will continue to evolve as trends change, but will always maintain its roots as an authentic German-style brew whose history and tradition will never be forgotten.","1887","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nJjPsG/upload_5EzK2B-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nJjPsG/upload_5EzK2B-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/nJjPsG/upload_5EzK2B-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","3122 W.

It is gaining popularity not only with beer lovers and beer drinkers, but in general with gourmets, top chefs and people who are always willing to explore new flavors and experiences and who care about what they ingest.","2012","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TUic1G/upload_Wy9IcJ-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TUic1G/upload_Wy9IcJ-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TUic1G/upload_Wy9IcJ-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Gewerbepark B 9","Bad Radkersburg","Steiermark","8490","+43 3476 41543","","46.6864396","16.0120422","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","AT","Austria","AUT","http://www.bevog.at","40","2012","","","",""
"XoN4oE","Beyond The Pale Brewing Company","Beyond the Pale was started as a small neighbourhood brewery by three local guys who grew up, went to school, and currently reside in the neighbourhood. Equipped with an old 400L brew system and a belief that there was room in the market for somebody wanting to make a variety of full flavour, unique beers, we embarked on our journey in early 2012. The concept was simple: make a variety of beers that WE wanted to drink and create a tasting opportunity for our customers to come into the brewery to decide what they liked, and buy to go.    During our first year of operation we released over 20 different beers, underwent one expansion, and our MO remains the same as it was in the beginning. In addition to the retail store our beers can also be found in over 30 local bars and restaurants.    You can be sure when you pick up a glass or bottle of our beer that you’re drinking a fresh local product. We work that little old brew house like a pack mule to crank out as much beer as possible. Nearly all of our beer is sold to customers within a week of leaving our brite tanks. That’s freshness that’s hard to find elsewhere.","2012","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0lwJsD/upload_B5R6hQ-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0lwJsD/upload_B5R6hQ-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0lwJsD/upload_B5R6hQ-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-09-04 10:40:10","5 Hamilton Avenue","North Ottawa","Ontario","K1Y 1B6","","Thu:  12:00pm - 8:00pm Fri:  12:00pm - 8:00pm Sat:  12:00pm - 8:00pm Sun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm  ","45.401639","-75.7307717","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","CA","Canada","CAN","http://www.beyondthepale.ca","124","","","","",""

"ghuJZE","Bierbrouwerij De Koningshoeven","The abbey opened a brewery inside the monastery in 1884 in order to finance the monastery and contribute to charitable causes. Despite this goal, the brewery was run as a commercial enterprise. The abbey owned several bars in the area and produced lager under its own ""Trappist"" brand as well as contract brewing for several private labels. In 1969, the abbey licensed the brewing operations to the Artois Brewery (now InBev). In 1980 the deal with Artois ended, and the monks went back to brewing themselves, this time a top fermented beer which had only been made in limited quantities since the 1950s. Over time the brewery introduced more varieties, first with Dubbel and Tripel in 1987, then in 1992 they introduced Blond. Between 1993 and 2000, the brewery also marketed a brand called Enkel. The brewery also produces the world's only Trappist witbier.

"QkdgSV","Big Muddy Brewing Co","All over the United States, craft breweries are continuing an American tradition which experienced an almost 50 year drought after the repeal of prohibition. Big Muddy Brewing in Murphysboro, Illinois is much like many of these new “microbreweries” all over the country, reinvigorating an industry and continuing a heritage that has skipped several generations.  Until 1940, Murphysboro was the home of a thriving brewery and until prohibition; it was one of the cornerstones of the town’s industry. In 1910, the Stecher Brewing Company produced more than 40,000 barrels of beer a year. However, passage of the Volstead Act in 1919, which ushered in the era of prohibition, began a slow decline to the brewery’s demise.  Big Muddy Brewing’s founder Chuck Stuhrenberg attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale in the 1980s. After graduation, he opened a franchise of Chicago’s Rosati’s Pizza in Carbondale and in 1990, began another venture, Spray Shield Industries.  It was while Stuhrenberg was in college at SIU that he began making his own beer.  Stuhrenberg and his college buddies would homebrew, and as the years went on, he began to take his hobby more seriously.  Stuhrenberg always had professional brewing in the back of his mind, but it stayed a hobby until 2009. In July, 2009, Big Muddy Brewing finally began production, the first brewery in Murphysboro in over 50 years.  The first beer offered by Big Muddy Brewing is Kinkaid Wheat. It was a recipe popular with Stuhrenberg’s family and friends. It was also something he felt would be a good “craft beer transition brew” for those used to the conventional corporate brew (BMC).  Kinkaid Wheat is currently offered on tap and by bottle in bars, restaurants and liquor stores across Southern Illinois alongside of Big Muddy Brewing’s second selection, “Saluki Dunkel Dog”, a dark, amber/dunkel style beer.  The third and newest addition to Big Muddy Brewing’s lineup is an ale called “Big Muddy Pale Ale”, and future varieties include “Logan’s Lager”.","2009","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_5b1YpK-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_5b1YpK-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/oBe8dQ/upload_5b1YpK-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","1430 North 7th Street","Murphysboro","Illinois","62966","(618) 684-8833","Sat: 11:00 am - 3:00 pm  `","37.7823381","-89.3321145","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","http://www.bigmuddybrewing.com/","","2009","","","",""

Family photographs capture moments of Cedric enjoying sunshine on the Loggia and sneaking in quiet naps in the library. Wherever George was, Cedric was sure to follow. That’s the kind of loyalty that inspires us to craft a quality beer—a beer worth your loyalty.    In fact, we’d been thinking of creating a line of Biltmore beers bearing Cedric’s name for many years. Then, when the decision was made to open a tavern on the estate, aptly named Cedric’s Tavern, as part of the new Antler Hill Village, the opportunity presented itself to turn the idea of producing a line of beer into reality. That’s how Biltmore Brewing Company was established.    Each beer in Cedric’s line is crafted to the exacting standards that George Vanderbilt appreciated and is made in the traditional English style. Craft beer enthusiast and newly appointed manager of Cedric’s Tavern, Bryan McIntosh has led the style selection of these new brews.","2010","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/cqA8ox/upload_vriUBU-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/cqA8ox/upload_vriUBU-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/cqA8ox/upload_vriUBU-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","1 Antler Hill Road","Asheville","North Carolina","28803","828-225-1333","","35.557734","-82.580672","Y","N","N","Y","office","Office","US","United States","USA","http://www.biltmore.com/our_wine/Biltmore_Brewing/Cedrics_Beer/","","2010","","","",""

"A5ES81","Birra Morena","Beer is an art and Drive Beer knows it well. Starting from this assumption, in 1999 The Tarricone Family takes over a factory, built in the '80es upon instruction of HM the Prince of Windisgraetz of the Austrian Family of Furstenberg who then bought the Prinz Brau Group. Later, in the '90es, this latter was acquired together with the Birra Moretti Group, by the Labatt Group.  In the next years, the Moretti-Prinz Brau Group was acquired by Interbrau and eventually by Heineken.  The entire know-how and the workers themselves have been kept by Drive Beer, thus assuring a continuity in the excellence of the brands produced.   The art of manufacturing fermented products and yeasts management is in the DNA of the Tarricone Family. Precisely, in the first years of 1900, the ancestor Giuseppe Tarricone owned several vineyards and produced an excellent wine. He was producing and selling his wine all across the inland of Lucania transporting it on his picturesque chariots drawn by horses.   He then moved the company office to Atella (PZ), and then to Bella (PZ), and eventually, bewitched by the beautiful landscape and the extraordinary nature of the surroundings of Muro Lucano (PZ), he settled down, together with his entire family of Corato origins, he married a Muro Lucano girl, whose name was Concetta Bianchini.  Therefore, when in 1999 the Tarricone Family was suggested by Gerardo, one of the sons of the ancestor Giuseppe Tarricone, to take over the Brewery, belonging to the Heineken Group, it was almost physiological to the five brothers, Giuseppe, Vito, Carlo, Federico e Fabrizio, who at that time were expanding their businesses linked somehow to the food and beverages sectors, to accept this ""challenge"", which represented for the Tarricone Family a ""return to the origins"".  The Drive Beer, an industry of the national market, has managed to impose itself as a beer pole, entirely Italian, competing with the most famous multinational companies.  Finally, the Company, based on the remarkable approvals made by operators, has then invested time and resources by recurring to the skills of expert advisors for realising an distributing the products.","1999","Y","","","","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Z.I.

After sampling one of the earliest batches of our flagship product, American Homecoming Pale Ale, we realized very quickly that it tasted better than even the most popular beer brands available in the regional marketplace. We were sure that others would enjoy our beer, and the positive responses from tasters everywhere have reinforced our belief in the quality and taste. We are committed to developing unique and flavorful beers, using the finest ingredients available. We are currently in the planning stages of the brewery and hope to have it up and running in the Washington D.C. area in late 2010 or early 2011.","2010","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xjjDoA/upload_WdPUPY-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xjjDoA/upload_WdPUPY-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xjjDoA/upload_WdPUPY-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","249 Burgess Ave","Alexandria","Virginia","22305","202-460-8541","","38.836252","-77.063694","Y","Y","N","N","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","http://www.blackcouchbrewery.com/","","2010","","","",""
"gCenwB","Black Creek Historic Brewery","Black Creek Historic Brewery recreates the techniques, tools and recipes used by brewers in 1860s Ontario. Our Brewmasters do everything by hand on a small scale. It's a great place to learn about beer because, unlike a modern commercial brewery, you can see every step in the process for yourself. And, no one else has a Brewmaster ready to welcome visitors in period costume.    In the 1860s there were 155 registered breweries in Ontario, and countless smaller operations. Black Creek Historic Brewery is the first in this province to replicate the brewing processes of that era, when there was no electricity or refrigeration, no stainless steel tanks or bottling plants.    The equipment at Black Creek Historic Brewery is made mainly of wood and copper, and the beer ferments the way it was done in the old days, with wooden barrels to age the beer. Malted barley is shoveled by hand into the wort tun where it is boiled into a mash. After filtering the solids through a linen cloth, the sugary liquid is boiled and hops are added, both for flavouring and as a natural preservative. Once the boiling is complete, the beer is put in barrels where the yeast is added. A short time later, the beer is ready!    Visitors can sample the beer at cellar temperature, the way it was enjoyed in the past, or drink a chilled pint in the pub, the way many people prefer it today. Either way, you’ll be tasting the authentic flavours of ales and porters made by hand, using only natural ingredients and genuine period recipes.    Visit the Black Creek Historic Brewery. It’s interesting. It’s fun. And the beer is great!","","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Cl1sHc/upload_Kv5iaK-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Cl1sHc/upload_Kv5iaK-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Cl1sHc/upload_Kv5iaK-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","1000 Murray Ross Parkway","Toronto","Ontario","M3J 2P3","416-736-1733","","43.774766","-79.5190859","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","CA","Canada","CAN","http://www.blackcreekbrewery.ca/","124","","","","",""

"LoZU74","Black Hog Brewing Company","Black Hog Brewing started with the story of food, family, and a love for craft beer. Brothers Jason and Tom Sobocinski come from a Polish/Italian family where food and drink is always the focus of every gathering. From Jason’s wedding to his son’s birthdays, roasting a pig has become the favorite way to celebrate any special occasion. Tyler Jones, an old family friend and former brewer of The Portsmouth Brewery in New Hampshire, contacted Jason and Tom with a plan to move to New Haven so his wife and son could be closer to their family. With a plan in the works to form a brewery that would celebrate family and food, they needed to encompass all that they were passionate about. When they celebrate, they roast a hog and the Berkshire hog is the breed of choice, thus Black Hog brewing was born!     Black Hog Brewing (BHB) will have a strong tie to local agriculture with a focus on unique craft brews that are pleasant to drink and pair well with foods of all types. Black Hog Brewing will craft year round and seasonal brews with a seasonal Farm Land Series dedicating a percentage of proceeds to support CT Farm Land. 3-4 pig roasts per year, using CT raised Berkshire pigs fed our spent brewing grains will celebrate the release of our seasonal brews.

At the Bloomington Brewing Company, we make beers that we like to drink. That’s the first rule. Great ingredients and attention to detail is the second. Our intention is not to grow a large brewery operation, our intention is to make great beer that we like to drink and to take care of our community.    We make only ales and they are available only on draft in Bloomington, Indianapolis and the surrounding communities. We do not bottle our beers. We’re not against bottling, and we will assuredly reach a point in the future where we will package our beer, but no matter how good a beer is in the bottle, it can never be better than the beer coming from a well managed tap. Often it will be not nearly as good. Why? Draft beer is fresher; that’s a big one. Packaging beer is a complicated process with lots of potential for bad things to happen.

No longer are viking wannabes and medieval enthusiasts the only people who get to knock back a glass of the original liquid sin. Now it’s your turn.    Mead has been around longer than any other drink on the planet, so we’ve had plenty of time to perfect the recipe. Blue Dog Mead is concocted with honey instead of grapes, making it a sweet, refreshing alternative to wine. Not to toot our own horn, but we think with one sip you’ll be hooked.    Our newly designed bottles are made to move, and we don’t just mean off  the shelves. We mean to the beach,in a backpack or while watching a game. You’re mobile and active, so why shouldn’t your drink be? No gimmicks here. Blue Dog just wants to go with you as you grab the   leash and take life for a good long walk.

"DF5YsC","Boston Beer Company","Today, we're a team of about 750 people, and we all share a common passion for bringing great Samuel Adams beers to beer lovers everywhere. We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an ""Entrepreneur of the Year"" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.    Jim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.    One of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: ""What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?""    Each year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, ""I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America."" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.

"0k2SXz","Boxcar Brewing Company","Boxcar Brewing Company is a community-oriented brewing company providing fine crafted beer to be enjoyed with family and friends.  The idea for Box Car Brewing Company originated in 2006 in Tennessee at the wedding of two of its chief members Jason and Kristen Kohser. In the mountains of Tennessee gathered a very small group of friends and family including Jason’s cousin Kymberly and her then boyfriend Jamie Robinson. After an intimate ceremony, the entire group enjoyed a reception complete with homemade guacamole and a tub full of crudely marked “homebrews” prepared by Jason. Prior to this, he had been working in high-end restaurants as a general manager, bartender and food server for over 20 years. He spent several years in Northern California learning the fine art of winemaking at a local winery in Sonoma. During this time Jason realized the beauty of brewing beer and his desire to share his creation(s) with others. He’s been brewing out of his kitchen sink for several years now, slowly perfecting his recipes, offering to teach others the art, and, most importantly, making and drinking some real good beer. Jamie, who has yet to find a brew he will not try, immediately was interested in Jason’s creations and quickly started picking his brain on the processes and formalities for creating these “homebrews”. While sucking down a few well-crafted brews in the hot sun, Jamie and Jason talked about their love of beer and the groundwork was laid.    A few months later, Jamie received a phone call from Jason, who had been mulling over the possibility of moving forward with the beer making, he then proposed the idea of moving to Pennsylvania. Jason asked if Jamie would be interested in working together and the dream of opening a brewery was declared. In 2007, Jason and his wife moved to West Chester, PA where many of his family live. Together with the other three members the idea was hatched to get serious and start brewing beer on a larger scale, for the beer lovers in Chester County, PA. Box Car Brewing Company became a reality.","2010","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PgnRc3/upload_ymsv6f-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PgnRc3/upload_ymsv6f-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PgnRc3/upload_ymsv6f-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","306 Westtown Rd","West Chester","Pennsylvania","19382","484-887-0538","","39.9620632","-75.5888196","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","http://www.boxcarbrewingcompany.com/","","","","","",""

"QYiAND","Brasserie D'Achouffe","Towards the end of the 1970s, Pierre Gobron and Christian Bauweraerts (two brother-in-laws) decided to create their own beer in their own brewery.   With initially only a small amount of money available to them (200.000Bfr, less than 5.000€), they started out on what the fans of the brewery call the ‘Chouffe story’.     At the beginning its founders thought of it as a hobby, but the brewery developed at such a rate that, one by one, they decided to devote themselves to the adventure full-time. The first ‘brassin’ (brewing mix) of LA CHOUFFE (49 litres) was finished on 27th August 1982.    The elves of Achouffe were impatient to discover new countries, and their Dutch cousins were the first to give them a warm welcome. Even today, the Netherlands is the major destination of Achouffe Beers outside Belgium. Nowadays, more than 20 countries worldwide are supplied with our ‘nectar’ from the Ardennes forests. Coveted international awards have also been received year after year to reward their unique taste.    At the end of the summer of 2006 the founders of the Brewery chose to entrust the future of their dear elves to the Duvel Moortgat Brewery. The group’s wish is to invest in Achouffe and to develop the full potential of the Brewery.","1982","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/D7h5Pj/upload_uOaWWF-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/D7h5Pj/upload_uOaWWF-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/D7h5Pj/upload_uOaWWF-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Achouffe 32","","Houffalize","6666","32-061-28-81-47","","50.16569","5.720881","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","BE","Belgium","BEL","http://www.achouffe.be/","56","","","","",""

"tpbOyx","Brasserie de Brunehaut","In 1890 the Allard family founded the Brunehaut brewery in Guignies, then called the St Joseph Brewery. It became known in the region for brewing beers like ""La Druide"" and ""Brunehaut 8°"". In 1991 the company took on a new challenge and moved into modern buildings while maintaining its traditional character and the quality of its products, qualified as ""grand crus"" by connoisseurs. An alliance of Modernity and Tradition!  These are the company's motto, a real creed for the managers at Brunehaut Brewery.    Tradition, because the traditional brewery retains the entirely natural brewing method for late fermentation beers and that are refermented in bottles and kegs. The result: a panel of about a dozen abbey or organic beers, all valuable and unique. To ensure that the link to the region remains strong, the types of barley used in the brewing process are grown in our own farm at Gaurain-Ramecroix.    Modern, because modern and high performance machinery ensure scrupulous compliance with hygiene regulations and a top quality production with consistent flavour. Also modern in how we deal with the market: several beers from Brunehaut won prizes at international competitions and are currently present in 25 different countries.  Marc-Antoine De Mees and his staff are still equally enthusiastic to allow the discovery of this knowledge and method.…","1890","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gOaK1T/upload_9MUB4f-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gOaK1T/upload_9MUB4f-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gOaK1T/upload_9MUB4f-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Rue de Panneries 17","Brunehaut","Hainaut","7623","32-069-34-64-11","","50.5111769","3.3891665","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","BE","Belgium","BEL","http://www.brunehaut.com/","56","","","","",""

The point being, we make complex, delicate, nuanced beers, not just the same typical west coast hop bombs or dark extremely high alcohol brews (though we make quality versions of those too). Our goal is to show the whole spectrum of beer, its history, and its evolution. To show beer its proper reverence, as not only ""The people's beverage"", but one that pairs as well with food as wine, and when it's skillfully crafted and not over hopped to hide the flaws in production, it does. The truth is, it takes more skill to make a delicate lager, than a double IPA.

"tKLtLu","Brauerei Reissdorf","During the period of promoterism – at the end oft he 19th century – the breweries in Cologne sprang up like mushrooms. In this era the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF – then called OBERGÄRIGE BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF (TOP-FERMENTING BEWERY) – was founded in the Cologne quarter “Severinsviertel” in 1894. Its founder, Heinrich Reißdorf, derived from an old-established farmer family who were based in Zieverich – today a quarter of Bergheim/Erft – as farriers and coach builders. A few years later, in 1905, the name Kölsch was established for the top-fermented Cologne beer-speciality. Before, it was called “Wiess”. After Heinrich’s death on 25.02.1901, Gertrud Reißdorf managed the brewery until 1908. The continuance of the company had never been in danger, though, since the Reißdorf couple had five sons, Johann Hubert, Heinrich, Hermann, Friedrich and Carl Reißdorf.    When the product range was diversified to further styles of beer – Märzen, Export (both a strong variation of Lager) and Pilsen – in 1923 the top-fermenting brewery was renamed to BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF – OHG. In 1917, when the men had gone fighting in World War I, Friedrich’s wife Katharina managed the brewery. The two had three sons: Heinrich Reißdorf, who was killed in an accident in the brewery in 1936; and the two proprietors Hermann-Josef and Karl-Heinz, who died in 1996 and 1997. They led the company through economically difficult times after World War II, when the brewery was destroyed to the extent of 90%. Against all odds, the two brothers managed to produce and bottle a “Einfachbier” (literally: simple beer) with 2-4% vol. alc. Today the business is continued in the fourth generation.    Due to a prosperous development of the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF, a new site for the brewery had to be found within the boundaries of the city of Cologne. Therefore, the company purchased premises in an industrial park in Cologne-Rodenkirchen. With the new production facility, a brewery with most modern brewing technology was built, which meets the highest quality criteria.    Continuity and a sense for the necessary are the virtues which make possible to look back on 110 years of an existing PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF. The ongoing success and the positioning of the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF in the highly competitive Kölsch-sector confirm this corporate philosophy imposingly.","1894","N","","","","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Emil-Hoffmann-Strae 4-10","Kln","Nordrhein-Westfalen","","49-(0)2236-/-9655-0","","50.87533","6.99444","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","DE","Germany","DEU","http://www.reissdorf.de","276","","","","",""

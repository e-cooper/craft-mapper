"qMu5Rj","Wicked Beaver Brewing Company","Wicked Beaver is a West Texas Craft Brewery, formed in Spring of 2009. We are a hands-on Brewery, with no automation to speak of, this keeps us in touch with every batch of beer we brew.  	  On an old dirt road, far from the beaten path, deep in the midst of no-where lives a Wicked Beaver. Why is he Wicked, you may ask? He is Wicked from the ways of the world, so many demands, too many deadlines, minor appreciation, and never enough time. So with little more than the stick in his hand and the Hops in his hanker chief, he journeyed West. Upon arriving in the West he hopped from the tailgate, choked on the dust, and kicked a tumble weed rolling his direction. This is the West, the place full of opportunity “he asked himself” and sighed but after a few Wicked Cold months, the landscape began to change, grass became lush green, trees bloomed and the flowers opened. The Wicked Beaver found the warm days, and cool nights were perfect to pursue his passion.    The Wicked Beaver and his brewing partners have been Brewing Craft Specialty Beer’s in secret for years, perfecting the fragrant aroma by blending only best hops and hand selecting the Malted Barley for the most unique varieties of flavors and textures. The Wicked Beaver is ready to share his unique creations with you!","http://www.wickedbeaverbrewing.com/","2009","N","","","","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","","PO Box 942","Wolfforth","Texas","","806-833-6969","","33.508643","-102.008987","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","2009","United States","USA","","","","","",""
"90gAzo","Wicked Weed Brewing Company","In 2009 Walt and Luke sat at a craft beer bar and talked about the dream of opening their own brewery that would focus on big West Coast hoppy ales and authentic Belgain ales that would inspire those who drank them. From that conversation forward there would be no looking back. A business plan was developed and hundreds of test batches brewed. In 2011 Walt and Luke’s lifelong friend Ryan Guthy and his parents Rick and Denise all sat down at their house in the mountains of Western North Carolina to taste some of Luke and Walt’s creations while looking over the plans for what would be Wicked Weed Brewing.  After being thoroughly impressed with the full flavor and vision of the project, the Guthys joined the Dickinsons and the team was assembled.  Over the next months Wicked Weed Brewing found a home at 91 Biltmore avenue, a building that seemed destined to be a brewery.  With the creativity of Luke, vision of Walt, dedication of Ryan, exquisite taste of Denise and wisdom of Rick a truly unique brewery was born.  So from the humble beginning of a basement, the dream of Wicked Weed Brewing has come to life. Our beer is bold, full of excitement and flavor.  Always focused on drinkability and pushing the boundaries of what we think we are capable of.  Wicked Weed Brewing will always evolve, always grow and always aspire to be greater.

"YbkkwZ","Wildcard Brewing Company","Wildcard Brewing Company was just a dream until experience, encouragement and circumstance made it a reality. The idea behind the name Wildcard is to pursue the unknown. Wildcard Brewing Company’s owners left stability for chaos, moved to England to learn the craft of beer making, and started a business in an uncertain economy, all in pursuit of a dream. You’d call them crazy, adventurous, unpredictable....a wildcard. Our story is one of the unexpected; a place where there are no limits, where perseverance and a free spirit will turn dreams into reality.     It started when Jeff and Jenny brewed two beers to give away as wedding favors at a brewery in San Luis Obispo where they went to college. Homebrew projects and burst bottle explosions ensued in the years after. But a casual passion soon turned career as Jeff and Jenny headed to England. Jeff studied brewing science at the University of Sunderland and Jenny conducted “research” in various local pubs. Once back in the states Jeff headed straight for the most competitive brewing location, the Pacific Northwest. Now 4 years later the pair are back in Jeff’s hometown of Redding building out their production brewery.    Wildcard is small startup business focused on brewing flavorful beers and enriching the communities that enjoy them. Spending dollars locally is just a part of that commitment. We will source products and services within 500 miles of our facility as much as possible and intend to exclusively sell beers within that same area. Supporting local businesses not only has great economic impacts but environmental as well. We don’t want to just do business in the Redding community we want to be a part of it. It is important to give back as much as possible to the community and we will make it a point to donate and get involved in local causes and efforts.","http://www.wildcardbrewingco.com/","2012","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TD4EGg/upload_DQdvya-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TD4EGg/upload_DQdvya-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TD4EGg/upload_DQdvya-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","9565 Crossroads Dr","","Redding","California","96003","(530) 722-9239","Wed - Thu: 2:00 pm - 8:00 pm  Fri - Sat: 12:00 pm - 9:00 pm  Sun: 12:00 pm - 5:00 pm","40.565865","-122.297279","Y","N","N","Y","nano","Nano Brewery","US","2012","United States","USA","","","","","",""

Its owners, the husband-and-wife team of Peter Ausenhus and Margaret Bishop, have lived near Northwood since their purchase of a nearby farmhouse and acreage in 1998. Nebraska natives, Peter and Margaret lived and worked in Minneapolis for many years before moving to Worth County, where Peter’s grandparents had lived and farmed and where Peter had spent much time as a boy.     Having already established Margaret’s engineering business in downtown Northwood, the couple turned next to Peter’s passion – brewing great beer. For 24 years, Peter has brewed award-winning beer, winning contests, teaching others and perfecting classic recipes along the way. He’s a BJCP National Beer Judge, has brewed professionally with Summit Brewing Company of St. Paul, Minn., and worked on staff at one of the country’s most popular brewing supply shops.    Worth Brewing Company is Peter and Margaret’s way of helping to reintroduce a great tradition – the locally owned brewery serving hand-crafted, high-quality, distinctive beers for the enjoyment of locals and lucky visitors. The nation’s small and mid-sized towns were once dotted with such breweries. Today, Worth Brewing – perhaps one of the world’s smallest craft brewers – brings a bit of those days back to delight the growing number of those who appreciate fine, locally brewed beers.","http://www.worthbrewing.com/","2007","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/5hWjSw/upload_Khe2DC-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/5hWjSw/upload_Khe2DC-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/5hWjSw/upload_Khe2DC-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","826 Central Ave","","Northwood","Iowa","50459","641-324-4991","Tap Room Hours:   Wed: 5 to 9 p.m.  Fri: 5 to 11 p.m.  Sat: noon to 11 p.m.","43.444055","-93.220486","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","2007","United States","USA","","","","","",""

So began the friendship of Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit.    As they made their way through college they continued to experiment with homebrewing and formulating new recipes. Proud of their product, they were eager to share it with friends. An instant favorite, it wasn't long until they realized their modest homebrewing operation wasn't going to be enough to satisfy the growing demand.    During the early 1990s, many breweries opened, and craft brewing started to gain popularity. Working in a small English-style brewery in Western Maryland, Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit decided to take matters into their own hands, and in 1994, they founded Yards Brewing Company.","http://www.yardsbrewing.com/","1994","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jwWiTH/upload_pXUGPy-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jwWiTH/upload_pXUGPy-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jwWiTH/upload_pXUGPy-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","901 N.

Trying to make tires more round proved to be less fulfilling than making great beer, so with the encouragement of Lila, Linus quit his job, got a business degree from Vanderbilt and a craft-brewing education through a course at the American Brewer's Guild, and did an internship under Garrett Oliver at Brooklyn Brewery. Linus found a used 10 bbl brewing system from a brewpub in Iowa that had gone out of business, and went to work restoring a corner of the old Marathon Motorworks building for their brewery.

"4V6C7Y","Yellowhammer Brewery","Launched in late 2010 in downtown Huntsville, Yellowhammer Brewing seeks to bring Belgian and German tradition to Alabama. That means Euopean styles, but with a slight Southern interpretation.  Thanks to Free the Hops and the change in Alabama's formerly restrictive beer laws, creativity in brewing has come to Alabama.    At Yellowhammer, head brewer Keith Yager draws inspiration from both Belgian and German brewing traditions. An accomplished home brewer since 1995, Yager has designed numerous seasonal and specialty batches, from the Dark Hammer Belgian Quad to the UberAlt sticke ale. Other recurring ales are more experimental, blending styles, as with Tobacco Road, an imperial amber designed to complement a good cigar, or the occasional Lonesome Hop series, which spotlights the character of an individual hop. Yellowhammer is Yager's first commercial undertaking.    Yellowhammer Brewing opened on Oct. 16, 2010 with the best-selling Belgian white ale and the IPA. Other staples sold throughout the year include a German style altbier and the Miracle Worker, a potent Belgian tripel.","http://www.yellowhammerbrewery.com/","2010","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BI8mE7/upload_h0FCyk-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BI8mE7/upload_h0FCyk-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/BI8mE7/upload_h0FCyk-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","2406 Clinton Avenue","","West Huntsville","Alabama","35805","256-975-5950","","34.722525","-86.603703","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","2010","United States","USA","","","","","",""

From that inaugural conversation grew plans for a craft brewery that would service the north with quality beer while keeping jobs and money in the territory.    Over a decade later Yukon Brewing, as it is called today, continues to work towards that goal. Employing a dozen or so staff (more in the busy summer months), Yukon Brewing actively supports countless Yukon events and causes each year.

The combination of the dark red soil, rich in ferrous oxide (which retains water) and climate allows the region to produce the award winning crop.  The Zatec brewery - built in 1801 - is situated inside the Zatec castle walls, overlooking the town and hop fields.  The brewery suffered for lack of investment during the Communist years until by 2000 the brew was hardly available even locally, much to the detriment of the Zatec economy. In year 2001 Rolf Munding purchased the brewery from a local business man and began a program of investment which has rejuvenated the brewery and improved the prospects for the beer, brewery and the people of Zatec, both as beer drinkers and brewers.  Tomas Lejsek, one of Czech Republic’s leading and most innovative brew masters has masterminded the changes, bringing together new technology, old brewing processes and pure ingredients.","http://www.zatec-brewery.com/","1801","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ABR6Y1/upload_bl1fXS-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ABR6Y1/upload_bl1fXS-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ABR6Y1/upload_bl1fXS-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Žatecký pivovar, spol. s r.o., Žižkovo náměstí 81,","","","Žatec","438 01","+420 415 710 783","","50.313918","13.534263","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","CZ","","Czech Republic","CZE","203","","","","",""

"wV9Hut","ÆppelTreow Winery & Distillery","ÆppelTreow Winery & Distillery is a producer of small batch cider, perry and spirits.    Cider and Perry?  We use the pre-Prohibition meaning of ‘cider’, so we’re talking about fermented or ‘hard’ cider. Perry is the pear analogue to cider.  We use lots of different kinds of apples and pears in our products.  Some modern.  Some heirloom – no longer grown for stores. We make a range of styles: sparkling, draft, still/table, and fortified/dessert.  Within a style, we lean to the dry end – but also have some medium-sweet offerings.    We are also a distillery.  We use Wisconsin grown crops and wood to make whiskey and brandies.  Distilled spirits may be powerful, but they are also flexible.  They are nice neat (straight up), and even more fun in cocktails.  We encourage people to mix our products up and add their own creative touch.","http://www.aeppeltreow.com/","","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/FbJSGN/upload_tU8JqF-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/FbJSGN/upload_tU8JqF-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/FbJSGN/upload_tU8JqF-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-08-04 10:59:35","1072 288th Ave","","Burlington","Wisconsin","53105","(262) 878-5345","Fri:  12:00pm - 5:00pm Sat:  10:00am - 5:00pm Sun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm  ","42.642658","-88.160186","Y","N","N","Y","cidery","Cidery","US","","United States","USA","","","","","",""

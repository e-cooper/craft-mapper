While large macro-breweries compete to produce the lightest, most flavorless, adjunct laden beers possible, craft breweries strive to out-do one another by making each beer hoppier, bolder, and stronger than the next.  At Brevard Brewing Company, we have set out to give beer lovers the best of both worlds – beer that is both drinkable and flavorful.  We are the only brewery in Western North Carolina to specialize in lagers.     What’s the big deal about lagers? Lagers are cold-fermented and aged over twice as long as ales.  They are more costly to produce, and take more patience to brew. Unlike the big flavors of ales that hide imperfections, lagers demand a higher standard of quality and care, making them a rare find in the craft beer world.  But the result is worth the attention to detail--this painstaking process creates a beer that is clean, smooth, and crisp as opposed to the bold, complex flavor of ales.  The imported German barley, hops, and yeast delivers delicate and refined beers that are delicious and flavorful, yet supremely drinkable.    While German-inspired lagers are my specialty, I will never forget the wonderful contributions that American home brewers have made to the beer world over the past thirty years.  I typically find myself drinking a cold, smooth, Pilsner, but every now and again, my taste buds crave a bold, hoppy American IPA.  This is why Brevard Brewing Company offers American ales in addition to German lagers.  No matter your mood or what you are craving, we have the right beer for you.","","2012","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/enoxkn/upload_H1vHPy-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/enoxkn/upload_H1vHPy-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/enoxkn/upload_H1vHPy-large.png","Mon:  4:00pm - 10:00pm Tue:  4:00pm - 10:00pm Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm Thu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm Fri:  2:00pm - 12:00am Sat:  2:00pm - 12:00am Sun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm  Monday-Thursday:  4:00pm - 10:00pm  Friday & Saturday: 2:00pm - 12:00am  Sunday: 2:00pm - 9:00pm","","",""

Brewer’s Alley is proud to continue the long history of beer making in a town known for its deep appreciation of fine fermented spirits.    Brewer’s Alley was located on what is currently South Court Street. Beer Production ceased in 1901 when a large fire consumed the brewery of John Kuhn, who was the last in a long line of brewers to occupy space along the banks of Carroll Creek. For over 153 years, from the very beginning of Frederick County, Brewer’s Alley was a fixture in the social and economic landscape of Frederick. Ninety-five years after leaving Frederick, Brewer’s Alley is back!    Brewer’s Alley’s location at 124 North Market Street is steeped in Frederick history. The first residents of Frederick held a lottery to raise money to build a town hall and market house on this location in 1765, which was completed in 1769. This structure served its purpose for over 100 years and was witness to the birth of Frederick as a city. The Market House spanned the Civil War, including the ransoming of the city by Confederate General Jubal Early.    In 1873, the bustling town of Frederick replaced the Market House with the ""new"" multifunctional offices, and provided space in the rear for the Frederick Farmer’s Market. Later, the rear of the building was replaced by the present parking deck; the first of it’s kind in town.    As the seat of city government the building was witness to Frederick’s political history, and as an opera house and theatre it has been witness to much of Frederick’s social and entertainment history. The building has hosted such diverse events as a Memorial Service for President McKinley in 1901, the Frederick debut of D.W. Griffith’s film ""The Birth of a Nation"", and the Manhattan Opera Company’s production of ""Madame Butterfly"", in 1926. It also hosted the popular American Legion fundraisers immediately after World War I, and the family pleasers the Mykle and Harden Fair Week Road Shows.    Brewer’s Alley has been fortunate in its efforts to preserve the elegance and glory of the old Opera House by being able to engage Salyer Studio Faux to faux decorate some of the original ceiling panels and columns in mimicked old Italian Sienna marble. The beautiful and captivating glass etching work and stained glass seen throughout the building done by Rusty and Sharon Rowland’s Art in Glass Studio complements this fine craftsmanship. Their rendition of the hop vines on the brewery glass and the stain glass panels in the back dinning room was all done by hand and is a joy to behold.    We are most happy to oversee the building’s latest transformation into the state-of-the-art brewery and restaurant. We hope you enjoy the history and ambiance of our location, as well as the brewery and dining experience.    We opened the doors in July of 1996 and have been serving great beers and wonderful meals to the masses ever since.","301-631-0089","1996","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_8Bijgx-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_8Bijgx-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wFeIiC/upload_8Bijgx-large.png","","","",""

Rickoli’s respects the liquid in the glass and wants to help elevate beer to a refined drinking experience. That’s why we use the finest ingredients and brew in a leisurely manner. The beer tells us when it’s ready. We refuse to be a slave to production deadlines.  Wheat Ridge Colorado is a relaxed community just west of Denver with easy access from I-70. Wheat Ridge was one of the few remaining enclaves along the Front Range without a microbrewery. This changed in November 2012!  We are dedicated to providing our local neighborhood with a place to relax and have a pint close to home.    Our Brew master, Rick Abitbol has been professionally brewing award winning beers along the Front Range for over a decade.  Rick is respectful of beer styles and traditional brewing technique.  And has long been an innovator of style and not afraid to color outside the lines. He was one of the first brewers to explore the Black IPA which has since come to be regarded as a new style in judging guidelines.   We love hops! That’s not to say you won’t find any wonderfully malty creations on tap there are many, but what you will notice is the variety in our hoppy selections.  Be on the lookout for Rick’s special brews!    We’re Talking Much Better Beer!  We are pleased to feature a great selection of Gluten Reduced Beer.  All Rickoli’s brews that do not contain wheat are considered gluten reduced.  Making great craft beer more accessible to everyone.      Our glass rinsing stations insure a beer clean glass every time! We want you to drink beer not sanitizer!

Through the integration of sustainable production methods, environmentally conscious waste management and innovative water recycling/reclamation techniques, we hope to become a model for breweries and agricultural destinations throughout the nation.    The BrewhouseThe brew house is an engineered mix of new and old technologies and techniques. Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.    The prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not. The beer is unfiltered, its clarity being attained by the addition of natural clarifying agents and allowing ample time for the beer to condition.    Brewery Terra Firma began brewing operations in May of 2013, with the taproom opening to the public in July of the same year.","(231) 929-1600","2013","","","","Mon:  10:00am - 10:00pm Sun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm  10:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Sunday","","",""

Things really got going for us as a business when in 1995 we took our Pear Cider to the Glastonbury Festival and sold it from our bar by the Jazz Stage. It went down so well that we kept going back year after year.    Ten years later to meet demand for Pear Cider all year round we bottled a small batch and sold it from our factory and on our website.

At Brothers Drake, our philosophy on making mead is based on the following principles:    1. Start Local: We buy local honey, support local agriculture, and produce a local product.    2. Use the Best: We look for the highest quality local product on the market, ordering from the best from the source closest to Ohio.    3. No Heat: We do not boil our honey or any water used in production. The No Heat Method keeps honey flavors true to the source and a better mead.    4. No Added Sulfites: Unlike grapes which have wild yeast growing on them, honey is naturally antiseptic and antibiotic, so no sulfites needed.    5. Build community: We share our knowledge openly and are grateful to people everywhere who ask questions, share their perspective, and engage in an open collaborative dialogue on mead-making.    6. Embrace creativity: Our mead can be paired with wonderful cheeses, appetizers, and entrees, as well as used in cooking and in mixed drinks.    These basic principles guide our craft, our partnerships, and our practices. We look forward to sharing a drink with you!","614-388-8765","","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IEFRaK/upload_L9x0MS-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IEFRaK/upload_L9x0MS-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IEFRaK/upload_L9x0MS-large.png","","","",""

After an education as brewer at the CTL in Ghent in the mid eighties, he kept experimenting and in the nineties he thought his time had come (and his ale was good enough) to commercialize his ale. After a decent study of the possibilities to start his own brewery, he decided to start with brewing in a existing brewery. The good thing about this formula is that it’s possible to brew profitable without big investments.

Because of the increasing demand of Lindemans' Lambic-beers the antiquated brewery became to slow to follow the production, so the Lindemans family decided in 1991 to build a new brewery next the old one to meet the growing needs of the market without any loss of quality.

At the end of this period, Pedro and his wife, Regina Wauters, bought the brewery from the others and Regina ran the business while Pedro served in the military. Their son Edward later took over the brewery (1864) and, it was during his directorship that the brewery saw great growth. Edward's son, Eugene, took over in 1878 and, in preparation for this position, travelled to England where he learned how to ripen beer in oak barrels and then mix old and young beers. It was this that became the method of producing beer that Rodenbach became famous for. As Eugene produced no male offspring, a public limited liability corporation was created and most shares remained in the hands of descendants of the Rodenbach's until 1998 when the brewery was sold to Palm Brewery.","32-051-27-28-10","1821","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qZJOHj/upload_GuFeW1-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qZJOHj/upload_GuFeW1-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qZJOHj/upload_GuFeW1-large.png","","","",""

Emile, his son, takes over and moves to Ingelmunster in 1900 and founds the St-Josef brewery.  Emile’s sons, Paul and Ernest, take over and expand firmly. In 1930 they build a new malt house and a foeder room and in 1937 a new brewing room, a fermentation room, a tank room and a bottling hall. Their focus still is on the traditional low fermentation beers: bock, export and lager.  Luc, the son of Paul, goes to brewery school and learns the trade as an apprentice in Germany and Wallonia.  Luc takes over in 1953, changes the name in brewery Vanhonsebrouck and decides to stop brewing lager and focuses on ‘old Flemish brown’, Bacchus.  In 1957 he starts with lambic and later on with Gueuze and Kriek under the name Saint Louis. Brewery Vanhonsebrouck becomes the second largest brewery of Gueuze, thanks to the shirt sponsoring of FC Bruges, European soccer finalist in 1976 and 1978. The production of Gueuze Saint Louis booms to a record in that time of 1 million kg of malt.  In 1980 Luc responds to the growing demand for heavy blond beers and launches Brigand, named after the farmer’s uprising against French occupation in 1798.  In 1986 the family buys Ingelmunster castle and 3 years later, the famous Kasteel(bier) is launched. It starts with ‘Donker’, than ‘Tripel’, ‘Rouge’ and ‘Blond’.  In 2009, the 5th generation, Xavier Van Honsebrouck, takes over.  His first achievement is the ‘Cuvée du Château’.  In 2012 the high exclusive Trignac follows and in 2013 Kasteel Hoppy.  In commemoration of a 100 years World War I, ‘Passchendaele’, a Belgian Top Blond, with only 5.2° alcohol is launched in 2013. A donation is offered to the community of Zonnebeke, to contribute in the preservation of its remnants of the Great War.

The recipe was developed by Willy De Lobel. In the absence of a brewing plant, Willy wandered through the Flemish hinterland in search of professionals that could brew his recipe.    His journey ended when he found the brewery of Dirk Naudts, called “De Proefbrouwerij”. There Dirk and his staff continued to perfect the brewing process of Viven.     In 2003, Willy De Lobel decided it was time to pass on his demanding hobby, to a young and ambitious entrepreneur. In the little village of Sijsele, Willy found an enthusiastic successor in the person of Tony Traen, the son of the local liquor dealer Cyril Traen, who decided the beer was an enrichment for his company and has since taken on the job of carrying on the tradition.    Since then, Chapel of Viven has undergone several changes: a brand new look, an improved recipe for the Monastery of Viven and a new name. Chapel and Monastry of Viven were baptized Viven Blond and Viven Brown.    In 2009 the time was ripe for an expansion of the range Viven. The idea to apply our Flemish brewing art to non-Flemish beers haunted Tony and together with Dirk he developed the recipes of the promising Viven Ale, Viven Porter and Viven Imperial IPA. These exceptional beers, that would truly tempt any beer connoisseur, have been successfully launched onto the beer market in 2010, making them accessible to a wider audience of beer lovers.","+32 (0)50 35 34 94","1999","","","","","","",""

It’s in the Wagner kitchen where Eric first combined his passion and talent for gourmet cooking with over 20 years of engineering expertise, specifically in treating water. Who knew that brewing delicious beer was so similar to the science of treating water? The process of releasing enzymes to break down starches into sugar and fermenting the sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide is second nature to a water engineer, while balancing delicious flavor is what a gourmet cook strives for. Hence the “blueprint” for great beer was born! Eric’s unique combination of talents led the way for the one-of-a-kind, handcrafted beer, each as original as a fingerprint.    Better than a recipe, a brewing “blueprint” combines science and great culinary skill to create a Brüeprint.    It’s with this vision that we bring Apex its first handcrafted Brewery—Brüeprint Brewing Company. The Wagner family, that is Brüeprint, is dedicated to traditional social interaction while sampling delicious beer.

The idea of making a mini brewery came from two people in Árskogssandur, the couple Agnes Anna and Olafur Trostur, after Agnes saw a small news report on Icelandic television. The report was about growing popularity of small breweries in Denmark, and a week later they were in Denmark to see breweries. Early in 2006 they found investers and today there are 15 individuals who share 44% of the company, and Agnes and Olafur own 56%.    The idea for Agnes and Olafur was to make a new brand of beer to sell, and they only wanted to make a beer which had high quality and rich taste, so they chose to use a Czech tradition beacause beers from Czech Republic are known for their good quality. Agnes and Olafur had two options of making the beer, they could either find a beer that they liked and buy the recipe and make the beer in Iceland, or make the choice they did. They hired a brewmaster named David Masa, a brewmaster from Czech and he has studied brewing for 9 years but the standard education is 4 years. They made their own beer from their ideas of good beer. They decided to make high quality beer, and use only the best raw materials they could get. They get all the materials from Czech Republic exept of course the Icelandic fresh water wich they get from a mountain in Arskogssandur.    The outcome  is Kaldi. An Icelandic beer, brewed by a Czech recipe and has only the best materials. The beer has no added sugar or any preservatives, an Kaldi is not pasteurized. All this makes Kaldi as fresh and healthy as he can possibly be.    In the beginning Kaldi was producedin 170.000 lt. per year. But due to very good sale of the beer and lot of requests , they had to add fermentation tanks and after that, Kaldi was produced in 300.000 lt. per year.     Bruggsmidjan now produces Kaldi, Kaldi dark, Kaldi lite and Gullfoss.","","","","","","","","",""

The idea of opening a brewery came to us in the spring of 2007, when we were both working as cooks in Spokane. At the time we were 18 and 21 years old. One spring day, we made the decision to quit our jobs and start a brewery. Shortly after that, we bought our first homebrew kit and brewed our first few batches. We knew that this is what we wanted to do with our lives. Our family encouraged us and helped us gather enough equipment to open our brewery. We became licensed to sell beer in Washington in January of 2010. We opened our new location and taproom at 2018 E Riverside Ave, Suite #1 in Spokane in May of 2011. We take pride in brewing quality beers made with the freshest ingredients around. All of our brews also contain a special touch of “Budge Bros Magic”. We have many exciting plans for the future, including an exclusive “Plastic Cup Club”, special events at the Taproom, seasonal brews, and cool new merchandise. We also serve the best Popcorn in the Greater Spokane Area.    While you’re here, feel free to poke around and check out the types of beer we brew.

We opened on March 25, 2011. The restaurant serves lunch and dinner with approximately 90 seats inside plus 35 seats of outside patio dining. We offer family friendly dining with a children’s play area, as well as a private meeting room for business gatherings and presentations or private events, all within full view of our own brewery.      The restaurant is very much “farm-to-fork,” working closely with North Carolina pasture raised beef farmers supplying beef with no hormones added and antibiotic-free meat that we grind daily to make our hamburgers and all-beef hotdogs.  We work with other farmers growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers for pickles, and lettuce. The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.  We like to say we are like fine dining in a burger joint.  We make the mustard, the slaw, the pickles, the mayo, the aioli, the hotdogs, the relish, the...    We are also a full scale working brewery and brew our own beer.  We have up to eight beers on-tap at any given time creating fresh ales and lagers rotating seasonally throughout the year. We use just malt, hops, yeast and water to craft our beer, leaving out adjuncts and additives. We take wine seriously and feature farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.    Central to Bull City Burger and Brewery’s core values is sustainability; our attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.","919-680-2333","2011","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_8LAKzQ-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_8LAKzQ-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/eu1cAn/upload_8LAKzQ-large.png","Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm  Friday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish  Closed Sundays","Suite 105","","http://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/manage/optin/ea?v=001qie9IeSPzo4U1KgkEFG5EQ%3D%3D"

We have been hard at work building this brewery keeping in mind sustainable practices and using local materials and craftsmen. We love our town of Berlin, Maryland and hope you join us in our taproom for a couple of pints and growlers. Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.    Why ""Burley Oak?""    The inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse.     Berlin, Maryland in Wikipedia   The town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of ""Burleigh Inn"", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).    It just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.","410-422-8887","2011","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rKXfsB/upload_ogqSYh-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rKXfsB/upload_ogqSYh-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rKXfsB/upload_ogqSYh-large.png","Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm   Thursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am  Sunday 12pm - 9pm","","","http://burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2"

Production levels peaked in 1915 when 65,000 barrels of beer were produced at the Hudson Facility.

The building was selected for it’s location, layout, and opportunity for expansion.

Jason and Brian met in 2004 at the Mountain Sun family of breweries in Boulder, Colorado were they both learned to hone the craft they love.  With over 15 years of combined professional brewing experience and an uncanny ability to tolerate one another, they decided it was time to take a leap and chase the dream of opening their own brewery.    With both Jason and Brian calling Golden, Colorado home, the choice for a location was obvious.  After settling on a property on the north side of town, they wanted the brewery name to reflect the home town they loved.  After doing some research they learned that the original name for the majestic Clear Creek that runs through the center of Golden was Cannonball Creek.  The historical significance paired with the duo’s love for the iconic Cannonball made the decision a no-brainer and Cannonball Creek Brewing Company was born.

Art co-founded one of the state's first microbreweries, Portland Brewing, as well as the Oregon Brewers Festival, which today is one of the world's preeminent craft beer festivals.     Cascade Brewmaster Ron Gansberg got his start in the Northwest wine industry. He crossed over in 1986 and began an eight-year career at BridgePort Brewing Co., where he honed his brewing skills, then moved on to the equipment and engineering side of the industry. As Engineering Manager at BridgePort, Ron directed the design and installation of the 80 bbl brewhouse that is still in operation.     Together, Art and Ron put their 40 years of beer experience to work, designing and installing Cascade's state-of-the-art 10 bbl brewing system in SW Portland, then creating and distributing well-balanced market-priced ales ranging from Pale Ale to Copper to Blond Bock. As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market.     Cascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation's largest craft brewing market. Even though there are an abundance of breweries in this area, it's highly competitive.

COTU began back in 2009 when Chris Ray and his brother Phil began brewing beer in their houses. The hobby turned into an obsession, and the obsession has led them to open up a craft brewery in Ashland, Virginia. Located in the heart of Central Virginia, it is affectionately known as “The Center of the Universe”. COTU will be brewing an assortment of ales using only whole ingredients, while sticking to the traditional all-natural method of brewing beer.    The meaning of “Center of the Universe” is important to the founders of COTU. With so much emphasis today on globalization and the lack of corporate stewardship, COTU wanted to be a company that truly embraces the local community. “Center of the Universe,” to COTU, is taking pride in where you live and respecting the people with whom you interact. We believe it is our responsibility to understand and appreciate how our actions affect the community that supports us.    At Center of the Universe Brewing Company it all revolves around the beer and the people who enjoy it.","(804) 368-0299","","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/B00bip/upload_INKScA-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/B00bip/upload_INKScA-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/B00bip/upload_INKScA-large.png","","","",""

Just like Sprecher, Chameleon Brewing supports the local economy and recognizes that innovative American brewing styles are now setting the bar in the international beer world. Chameleon is a company focused on taking brewing to the next level by producing beers that are guaranteed to impress the savviest critic, yet also appealing to a widely diverse group of beer drinkers. Our brews are light bodied and refreshing, complimented by a fine balance of complex flavors and aromas.    Staying true to this principle, Chameleon would like to introduce its flagship beer – Hop On Top extra-pale ale. This aromatic non-bitter brew features a complex bouquet of dried flowers and hops. Easy to drink, Hop on Top has a toasty pale malt finish.","414-964-7837","2010","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/SUhNVs/upload_werrLQ-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/SUhNVs/upload_werrLQ-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/SUhNVs/upload_werrLQ-large.png","","","",""

In Italian immigrant Pete Prichard's effort to support his family, he came up with the idea of using an Indian Territory recipe to brew a beverage for the coal miners.    Pete's idea led to trouble during Prohibition. He was convicted, not once but twice, for breaking the federal Prohibition Act.    Prohibition was repealed in the late 1950s, but home brewed beverages were still illegal because they didn't bear the proper liquor stamps. Nevertheless, homemade Choc and wine continued to be available to regular customers at Pete's, a restaurant owned by Prichard in Krebs, Okla.    Those customers happen to include JFK and high-powered Oklahoma politicians.    Finally, in 1995, through tireless efforts on the part of Joe Prichard, the grandson of the founder, Pete's Place reintroduced Choc beer as part of the restaurant's tradition and a ""legal"" brew for customers.","918-423-2042","1919","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TI53eD/upload_IiadV5-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TI53eD/upload_IiadV5-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TI53eD/upload_IiadV5-large.png","","","",""

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars. The brewery is the first American craft brewer to rescue a City's heritage beer brands and owns Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co. including the brands of Hudepohl, Hudy Delight, Hudy 14-K, Burger and Little Kings Cream Ale brands.","513-827-6025","1853","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_SbijT7-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_SbijT7-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Em1uno/upload_SbijT7-large.png","Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm Thu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm Fri:  4:00pm - 12:00am Sat:  12:00pm - 12:00am Sun:  12:00pm - 7:00pm  ","","",""

Having been homebrewing for a couple of years, Tom wrote a ‘cartoon’ of a business plan that stated that a 3 barrel brewery could make a profit (in the first year, no less!).    Armed with said business plan and a cashed in 401k, Tom and his wife DeAnn proceeded to convert a metal storage shed on their property into a nascent brewery.    Lake Louie Brewing is located on 18.5 acres of land purchased from Tom’s uncle Louie Carpenter (hence the name ‘Lake Louie’) near the small town of Arena, Wisconsin (population: not too many, traffic lights: zero).  Lake Louie was the skinny dipping pond for area youth (including Tom in his day).    At the end of one full year’s brewing, Lake Louie has produced the astounding sum of 106 barrels of beer.  2001 year end totals:  276 barrels.  A 258% increase in one year (lookout Bud!).","","","","",""

Not just a love of drinking beer but a real respect for the craft, the history, the art, and the industry, as well as a love for the brewing process itself. Today, Lake Placid Pub & Brewery has been brewing award-winning ales for 14 years and has expanded rapidly due to its popularity and quality, earning the respect of the brewing community.    In 1996, Christopher Ericson and a college friend purchased P.J. O'Neill's, a pub in the small, Adirondack village of Lake Placid. They renovated the upstairs into a pub and restaurant, installed a seven barrel brewery, and began brewing. Chris' brewing experience included Federal Jack's / Shipyard Brewing in Kennebunkport, ME and The Shed Restaurant and Brewery in Stowe, VT.  The Lake Placid Pub & Brewery soon became a popular spot both for locals and visitors to the Lake Placid area.","","1996","","",""

In small villages across Europe, it was the local brewer that filled the vessels of pubs and cafés with beer made from his own closely guarded recipes. With the advent of industrialization, however, local breweries all but disappeared, bringing to an end the era of the authentic microbrewery.    Twenty years ago, a family of brewers decided to revive the traditions of the past that were deeply rooted in three generations of their family – thus the name The 3 Brewers – “three” for three generations of brewing tradition. The 3 Brewers opened its very first microbrewery restaurant in Place de la Gare à Lille in 1986. Since then operations have expanded to 28 locations in France as well as several restaurants in other parts of the world including Quebec and soon Ontario.    Les 3 Brasseurs' success can be attributed to a unique concept: Fresh non-pasteurized beer made from the purest ingredients and from traditional recipes – all brewed right at the heart of each of our restaurants for patrons to see.","Monday: 11:30 - 24:00  Tuesday: 11:30 - 24:00  Wednesday: 11:30 - 24:00  Thursday: 11:30 - 1:00  Friday: 11:30 - 2:00  Saturday: 11:30 - 2:00  Sunday: 11:30 - 24:00","1986","","",""

Our brewing process utilizes the traditional English method of upward infusion mashing in our combination mash lauter tun to create lagers and ales inspired by old world values, but with modern quality and consistency. The staff at The Lion Brewery is dedicated to producing true handcrafted beers, made right here in our century-old Brewhouse. All of our premium beers are made using only the four basic ingredients allowed by the Reinheitsgebot, or German purity law. Under the skillful supervision of our Master Brewer, Leo Orlandini, each of our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches using only the finest hops and malts available to guarantee the highest quality and freshness. Each product we brew is an original recipe especially created to deliver a fuller flavor than ordinary beers, yet with an approachable style and character. As a result, our beers have garnered numerous medals from the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Championships in recent years.    In 1974 the Lion Brewing Company bought the Stegmaier Brand.","","1857","","",""

Legend has it the second floor saw the first meetings of the local Masons. The Steinway piano prominently displayed in the pub was originally brought into the building in 1899. It has never left the building, and is the same piano that was used during the early 20th century to accompany silent films. During our extensive renovations of the building, we elected to preserve the original walls of the first floor, to honor the history of this building and the Frye Brothers themselves, the original builders.       We are grateful for the opportunity to establish our business in historic Wardensville and proud to become a part of the local community.

With a background in the food industry and many years of beer research, it was only natural for Steven to start brewing at home, and wasn't long before he started creating his own recipes. Now a year later, Low Brau continues to move forward, with plans to open it's doors within the District in the next year.     Low Brau's beers are German inspired, following the guidelines set fourth by the Rheinheitsgebot Purity Law and high quality ingredients.

Let’s start a craft beer brewery!”  That Clarity in Thinking, led to the successful launch of Lucid Brewing.    In June of 2011, with a year of planning already completed, they realized jumping headfirst into the brewery was the only way they could make their dream a reality.  They quit their day jobs.      With that leap of faith – and a ton of support from many friends and family – they started building their brewery from the ground up.  Through the sweltering heat of the 2011 summer, many friends labored side by side with Jon and Eric.  They did it all, start to finish, from digging trenches to assembling the last tank.  So of course they needed a refreshing and light drink to quench their thirst while they toiled away.  They found just the right recipe and brewed their first beer – AIR.  A beer made to get the job done.  Its slight citrus aroma and flavor, lower ABV and crisp dry finish made this their favorite “go to” beer.      By October the brewery was complete and cooking.  And in the spirit of the season, Eric and Jon gave thanks to the Brew gods when they made their first deliveries to their first three customers the week of Thanksgiving… in Jon’s car.  Lucid was on its way!    Always keeping an eye on the demand for high quality while quickly catching the craft beer lover’s attention, Lucid assembled a team of dedicated employees and introduced brews to quench their customers’ demands.   AIR, DYNO, FOTO and DUO, along with seasonal and small-batch brews, are quickly becoming Minnesota favorites at local bars and restaurants.      Great success has followed them after throwing away the daily grind for the daily brew.","Thu - Fri: 5:00 pm - 8:00 pm  Sat: 12:00 pm - 5:00 pm","2009","www.LucidBrewing.com","",""

Some drive across state lines to acquire the finer choices at festivals and suppliers alike, while others exchange trades with those from other states in search of the locally forbidden. But for those who truly take matters into their own hands, homebrewing beer becomes the purest form of gratification.    Driven by an extreme passion for both innovation and beer, our Brewmaster took what was once just a dream and decided to create a beer that would not only break state laws but also help change the very same laws that Mississippi has let fall behind. For eight years, he brewed beers of many different styles as a hobby - and with each tasting that he would hold at his home, the crowds grew larger. Eventually, he would be convinced that this beer should be available to those patrons who also appreciate the finer beers of the world.    Lucky Town Brewing Company was founded on this very notion – to craft beers that break boundaries between the working men and women of Mississippi and their wish for locally produced premium beer. With that mission, Lucas Simmons decided to grant those wishes by sharing his passion for crafting beer in 2011.","","2011","","",""

Within an hour, one can be skiing or biking in the Bridger Mountains or Big Sky area, enjoying a hike in one of seven mountain ranges, or fishing world-class rivers.  The latter is where our name originated.     The Madison River has earned the reputation as one of the best places to fly-fish in the world.  Because the river is located in our backyard, current Brewmaster/President, Howard McMurry chose Madison River for the name of our world-class brewery.  Sticking with the theme, most MRBC beers carry the name of a fishing fly.    Madison River Brewing Company, Inc. started in 2004 when Howard purchased the brewery and equipment from Moab Brewing.  At that time, we contract-brewed for Moab, Park City, and Big Hole breweries. In 2005, Madison River Brewing Company emerged when we received a state license to brew our own brands.","","","","",""

Along with that vision they put their own “mad twists” on their creations. The MadTree approach is simple – create high quality beer, educate the consumer, run a responsible business, and support the local communities.  MadTree engages local artists and craftspeople for their marketing materials, can designs, tap handles and furniture. Many of these efforts have received local and national recognition.    HIGHLIGHTS  - The trio quit their corporate jobs in 2012/2013 and in January 2013 they brewed their first commercial batch.  - In April they opened their taproom and became the first modern craft brewery to can their beer in the state of Ohio.  - Draft Magazine rated PsycHOPathy IPA a 97/100, the second best score for an IPA reviewed by Draft Magazine.  - PsycHOPathy IPA was named as one of the “Six New Craft Can Designs That Belong in an Art Gallery” by craftcans.com","","2013","","",""

Krook's Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.    Four years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000, we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River. In 2003, we added a Stone Pizza Oven and a Sushi Bar to expand our menu selection. Today you can still find the scale, now an antique, that was once used to weigh the wool brought into the factory.","","1996","","",""

This led to a great diversity of beer in both taste and style. Manorhouses brewed to seasons and used beer as both sustenance and social lubricant. Manorhouses and the beer they produced were unique to families and the communities of which they were a part. We will fulfill all those same criteria.     Manor House Brewing represents an alternative to conventional beer, we are prideful in our local roots and want to inspire pride in our local community. Our beer is an output of a thoughtful creative process and we view what we do as art, not commodity. We experiment with new things, but try to predict the outcome in advance. Every so often, we accidentally stumble upon greatness.    Why do we want to brew beer? To satisfy a longing for the simple pleasures and a simpler time. Happiness, joy, and relaxation is our goal.    How are we different from every other craft brewer? The very same thing that makes us the same. We are creative, innovative and different. We do not feel compelled to brew to style as we may create our own, but when we do brew to style, we do so with passion.","","2009","","",""

They purchased a small pub called the Freemasons Hotel in Fremantle, Western Australia, installed a brewery and reopened as the Sail & Anchor Hotel. The brewery at the pub enabled the guys to control the quality and presentation of the beers and talk directly to the growing legions of converts.       Soon after this the rapidly expanding outfit acquired a property in Nedlands and opened as the Matilda Bay Brewery, producing its main brands Redback & Dogbolter as well as a raft of other specialty craft beers. At the same time the group had an expanding portfolio of hotels including the ‘Port Melbourne Brewing Co’ operating as the Redback Hotel in Flemington Road, North Melbourne.     In 1988 the Brewery again moved to bigger premises, an old renovated Ford factory in Stirling Highway, North Fremantle to continue to cater to the growing demand for Matilda Bay beers. In the early 90s Matilda Bay Brewing Company became a part of the CUB family – an arrangement that would see the beers reach truly national distribution.     In 2007 we relocated to the vibrant craft beer scene in Victoria, and continued brewing first in Dandenong and most recently at an old renovated Cadbury’s chocolate factory in Bertie St Port Melbourne, which includes a bar & restaurant – so we can again talk directly to our beer lovers.     Throughout the years we’ve produced some of Australia’s favourite specialty beers & ciders, and along the way bagged a swag of trophies and awards. Our highly regarded Head Brewer – Scott Vincent – leads our brewing team with pride as they continue on the mission established in 1984 at the Sail & Anchor Hotel.","Bar  Tues – Thurs: 11am – 10pm  Fri – Sat: 11am – 11pm  Kitchen  Tues – Thurs: 12pm – 3pm /  5pm – 9pm  Fri – Sat: 12pm – 10pm   Sun – Mon : Closed","","","",""

Being lovers of great food and beverage and local produce, the rich tapestry of McLaren Vale always delivered. As the boys got to know the wine community and gained a deeper understanding of the region, they realised there was a tremendous opportunity for a beer producer to add another dimension to the local offering. Beer has long been a popular post-work refreshment for the wine community and we like to think that behind every great wine is great beer.  Us South Aussies are spoilt for choice when it comes to great food, beverage and produce. We have an appreciation for the good things in life, having grown up with such quality at our fingertips. This is the reason we started a beer company in this great state. We feel at home here and with that comes a responsibility to play a part in the great food and beverage offering.","","2008","","",""

In 2011 our breweries collectively crafted 3302 batches of beer (including over 250 new and unusual house-specific recipes) more than 47,263 kegs of beer or an astounding 5.8 million pints!    In keeping with McMenamins' company philosophy, our breweries believe that brewing ""green"" is brewing responsibly.    Many beer lovers are familiar with our ales, such as Terminator Stout, Hammerhead, Ruby, Edgefield Wheat, Black Rabbit Porter, Sunflower IPA and others. Read more about these ""standards"" and dozens of others, including our beloved seasonal ales.    Due to the nature of handcrafting, it's safe to say that no two McMenamins batches are identical. Science and technology provide the backbone for our craft, but it is the unique qualities of each brew house, and the individual brewer's ale-crafting style, that ensure you will enjoy liquid refreshments that are truly special and made with every care for the environment.

With five generations of family lineage handcrafting beverages in South Dakota, and with 15 years as winemaker and owner of Prairie Berry Winery, Brewmaster Sandi Vojta is inspired by the traditional brewing styles of her family’s European heritage. By infusing regional and seasonal ingredients into the recipes handed down to her, she has skillfully adapted those traditional styles to create craft beers with a regional character, setting each distinctly apart from other microbrews.    All of our beers are produced in small, 15-barrel fermenters, allowing us to keep each batch small enough to maintain microbrew quality and a close attention to detail at all times. The results are craft beers that are approachable and distinctive, to be enjoyed by craft beer novices and enthusiasts alike.    We invite you to experience Miner Brewing for yourself, as we open our Tap Room in Hill City this fall 2013. Stop on by for a flight or a glass, hang out to enjoy our seasonal selections, and stay a while for a little South Dakota hospitality.

There’s nothing more enjoyable than a pint while watching the beer you’re drinking being made a few feet from where you’re sitting.  No catchy gimmicks. No national campaigns. Just great handcrafted beer made in San Diego!","","2007","","",""

We’re at the foot of Lookout Mountain just steps away from the world-famous Incline Railway and very near to the great Moccasin Bend of the Tennessee River.     MBBC was started by two brewers whose quest for the perfect beer led them to learn the art of brewing.  Chris Hunt and Duncan Guy began their brewing education in the Barley Mob Brewers homebrewing club and continued to search for unique and distinctive ale and lager formulas. They decided to offer their creations to the public through a small batch microbrewery in 2006.  Soon thereafter, award-winning brewer Courtney Tyvand joined the two and presented his smoked porter at the brewery’s first beer dinner in October of 2006.    The brewery is located on the ground floor of a historic building at 4015 Tennessee Avenue in St. Elmo.  The building is constructed of foot-square cedar timbers and two-foot thick walls made of granite stone and mortar.  Built in 1911 as a packaging factory for K-Rations for WWI, we occasionally find artifacts from that era in the building walls and ceiling.  The brewery shares space with the Chattanooga U-Brew, a brew-on-premises business owned by Greg McCort.     MBBC is proud to offer small batch specialty ales and lagers in kegs of various sizes.  A tasting room is part of the brewery; samples of our beers can be tasted and tested on premises.  Occasionally we have tasting events or tapping events at the brewery or at a nearby bar or restaurant.  Please check our calendar for scheduled tasting events at the brewery.","","2006","","",""

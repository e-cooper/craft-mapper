Continuing the tradition of Michigan and Craft brewers before us, we will create unique hand crafted Ales and Lagers, that will challenge expectations and ideas of what great beer really is. With a focus on premium quality, handmade Ales and Lagers, FDBC will present a new unique product to the Detroit area.    Made in Michigan and the U.S.A.    One of the missions of FDBC is to create jobs and spur the economy in Michigan and the U.S. in general. At opening we plan to have 18 positions available with that number doubling year to year. Our long term goal is a bottling factory and additional restaurants that will employee hundreds of local workers.    Keeping with our philosophy of locally sourced goods and services, we will purchase from local companies whenever possible. On the food side this includes local fish markets, meat markets and bakeries; and on the brewery side designing beers that will be made using Michigan grown hops and malt. And it doesn’t stop there! We are actively negotiating and designing the brew house, promotional materials, general construction and website operations with Michigan companies.    Where it is not possible to source a product or service locally or in the State of Michigan, we will be looking first to keep our business in the Mid-West and then United States. We call this an inside-out sourcing philosophy. First source at the city level and slowly work out by county, state, region and country. We feel this benefits everyone in this endeavor where we support the community that is supporting us. A Win-Win for everyone!    It’s All About the Beer!    We are going to be creating quality; handcrafted beers that we believe will be some of the best beer you have ever tried. We are also going to push the envelope and make beers with unique and far-out ingredients that will invite you to be different and maybe live a little on the edge.

"9KTxIH","Farnum Hill Ciders","Farnum Hill Ciders fulfill the true meaning of the word “cider” -- alcoholic beverages fermented from apples, exactly as wines are fermented from grapes. But not just any apples: in our orchards grow more inedible tannic weird genuine cider apple varieties than anywhere else in the States. Many originated in the gentler climates of France or England. In our tough conditions, these varieties produce intense, concentrated flavors and aromas not typical in their home regions.  Our own ciders, at 6.5-7.5% alcohol, tend toward the dry, sharp, fruity and bountifully aromatic. We intend them to gladden the moment and to freshen the flavors of companionable foods. We are proud of Farnum Hill Ciders, and we are authoritatively told that, for now at least, they are the best-made ciders in America.  Let's hope many more Eastern apple-growers will learn the craft and horticulture of cidermaking, and that distinctive American orchard-based ciders, now too rare, will return to their pre-Prohibition glory and variety. Johnny Appleseed planted the frontier for cider, after all -- “Mom and apple pie” came later, blotting out certain enjoyable truths from the national memory.

Here is a little rundown about what Fifty West is all about:    All the beers brewed at Fifty West Brewing Company have been hand made in small batches with a focus on craftsmanship, tradition, innovation, and patience.    There are several reasons why we selected the name ‘Fifty West’; the most obvious being the fact that our brewery is located on Route 50, which extends from Coast to Coast- it spans more than 3,000 miles starting in Maryland and stretching all the way to California.     The brewery is located in a building that has a vast and varied transient history (http://www.cincinnati.com/dining/heritage/history.html); from the settlers heading west through the Ohio River valley, to the days of Prohibition when our building was a favorite of George Remus and the bootleggers running whiskey from Cincinnati to Chicago, to where we are today—amidst a renaissance of the craft beer movement.    To us, it’s not about the destination, but instead making sure we are enjoying the journey, appreciating the moment, and brewing beers that are enjoyed by anyone who is willing to let us become a part of their journey.","http://www.fiftywestbrew.com/","2012","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/832aZM/upload_kfBiJc-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/832aZM/upload_kfBiJc-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/832aZM/upload_kfBiJc-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","7668 Wooster Pike","Cincinnati","Ohio","45227","(440) 477-0163","39.138724","-84.353144","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","","United States","USA","","","","",""

After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth's distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple's travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company's brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you're sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking.

The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.    As George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an “amateur mountaineering expedition” to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.

Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it’s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That’s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don’t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn’t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn’t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, “it is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.","http://www.flyingdogales.com/","1983","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmGoBA/upload_0z9L4W-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmGoBA/upload_0z9L4W-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmGoBA/upload_0z9L4W-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","4607 Wedgewood Blvd","Frederick","Maryland","21703","301-694-7899","39.361926","-77.424677","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","1983","United States","USA","","Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).","","",""
"qjZIZq","Flying Fish Brewing Company","When Gene Muller founded Flying Fish Brewing Co. in 1995, he did so first on the World Wide Web - making it the world's first virtual microbrewery. That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site “This Old House meets the World Wide Web”—letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.    He also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.    Muller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order).

That’s why she asked young Benjamin Fordham to start a brewery in the new port of Annapolis. Benjamin’s passion and dedication to making the highest quality brews were evident in every pint and the colony flourished!    Almost 300 years later, Fordham brewing was re-born in the heart of Annapolis in 1995.  With the ever-increasing demand, this frothing Fordham giant was more than our small brewery could handle. In an effort to provide more people with our brews, our plucky staff grabbed our recipes and moved Fordham to its new castle in Dover, Delaware…a brand new stainless steel castle of opportunity!    Despite geographical changes, our brewery is happy and healthy in Dover, and more productive than ever before.

The company's ownership consists of both English citizens and North Carolina natives, and our beers will utilize premium English malts and hops as well as locally-grown ingredients.     Fortnight Brewing will be located in Cary NC with plans of opening in Summer or Fall of 2013.

With a focus on the revival of artisan brewing, we strive to create the highest quality products available.    Brewing techniques as timeless as beer itself are used to create a uniquely handmade product. We craft the finest possible beer in small batches normally not found in the industry today which is typically dominated by mega mergers of international breweries. Is this difficult and more time consuming? Yes. Does it require more manual labor? Yes. Is it worth it? Unequivocally, YES. As beer is a “living, breathing” product made from precise strains of active yeast cultures, it just makes good sense to nurture the product in very manageable small batches. We believe that the extra care and attention devoted to each batch produces the best possible result and you as our friends deserve no less.    We hope that you will have the opportunity to experience the limited quantities of hand crafted beer that we produce in Charlotte. When you do, please notice the complexities of the aroma, the silkiness of its body, and the explosion of flavors as the grains merge artfully with the yeast cultures and noble hops blended meticulously for each variety. Join us in celebrating the pleasures of hand crafted beers and life in the Queen City finally merged into this moment in time and allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying a uniquely Charlotte experience.","http://fourfriendsbrewing.com/","2007","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hcCgPK/upload_XaEKBW-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hcCgPK/upload_XaEKBW-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hcCgPK/upload_XaEKBW-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","10913 C Office Park Drive","Charlotte","North Carolina","28273","","35.12048","-80.9595499","Y","N","Y","N","micro","Micro Brewery","US","2007","United States","USA","","Saturday: 3pm - 7pm","","","2014"

Legend has it that water from the well had miraculous and curative properties, and people wold come from afar to drink from it.    The Brewery has combined modern technology with age old tradition in forming classic beer styles including lager, ale, stout, and wheat beer. All of the beers brewed at the Franciscan Well are natural, unlike some commercial beers that can contain chemical additives, preservatives and cheaper ingredients.    The Brewpub houses three serving vessels located directly behind the bar, which dispense our beer to the taps.

John Matthias Falliers founded Frankenmuth’s first brewery in 1857. Cousins William Knaust and Martin Heubisch opened the Cass River Brewery just north of the Fallier property in 1862, where the Frankenmuth Brewery continues to stand today.    The Cass River Brewery was purchased by Johann Geyer in 1874, and renamed Geyer’s Brothers Brewing Co. For the next 112 years, the facility operated under many names including the Frankenmuth Brewing Co. Ferdinand “Fred” Schumacher from Duseldorf, Germany, purchased the brewery one year before a fire destroyed most of the structure in 1987.    The microbrewery continued operation following ownership acquisition by Randall E. Heine in 1990. The nation’s second oldest microbrewery was at peak production in 1996, distributing more than 30,000 barrels of locally produced microbrews across 25 states, when a F3 tornado struck our facility, causing several million dollars of damage. A brew pub was opened in 2003 and closed three years later.

"lxWkzT","Frederic Robinson Ltd.","Frederic and Emma Robinson with their son WIlliam and daughter Mary. William, pictured here with his mother, went on to marry Priscilla Needham in 1899 and became Chairman of Frederic Robinson Limited in 1920.  Fast forward to the early decades of the 20th century and Frederic’s grandchildren, sons of William, joined the family business. After Frederic’s passing, his widow Emma owned the business in entirety and it was shortly prior to her death that she instigated the formation of Frederic Robinson Limited. 4th generation Robinsons, Frederic, John and Cecil joined the board and continued to build the company alongside their father William.    With bottling commencing from a new building in 1908, new offices in 1913 and a new brewhouse in 1929, by William’s death in 1933, despite the countries difficult economic climate, Robinsons was strongly positioned for further growth. Over the following years, the estate grew by acquisition, new buildings and extending the geographical area. The first Welsh house – The Black Lion was bought in 1943. William Robinson, would have been proud to hear John, his great grandchild, was honoured with a knighthood in 1958 for political and public services in Cheshire- 120 years after William purchased the Unicorn Inn. The early 1950’s saw 5th generation Robinsons, Peter, Dennis and David, starting to join the business.    Over the past 6 decades Robinsons has continued to grow. 15th October 1975 saw the first bottling at a newly built packaging centre in Bredbury- ongoing development at UPC (Unicorn Packaging Centre) means all our beers are now transferred from Unicorn Brewery to Bredbury for packaging and distribution once fermentation is complete. Robinsons’ bottled ales such as Old Tom and Unicorn are distributed worldwide. The sixth generation strive to build further upon the family legacy. Neil, Veronica, Paul, Oliver and William were elected to the board in September 2003, followed three years later by Sara, who is now Company Secretary and John in May 2009.    Our eyes are firmly on the future as we develop brewery, brands and pubs at pace.

"FEPzbD","Freedom Brewery","Established in 1995, Freedom Brewery is a pioneer of premium craft lager brewing in the UK. Now one of the leading brewery’s in this sector, Freedom’s range of beers have won over 25 International and National awards in the last 4 years alone.    All Freedom Beer is bottom fermented in closed, pressurized vessels. Lager is fermented at a lower temperature than ale and therefore takes longer – between 7 to 14 days, in contrast to 4 to 5 days. During fermentation, the beer naturally carbonates itself as a result of the breakdown of sugars to alcohol.    After the fermentation stage, the ‘young’ beer is transferred to maturation or storage tanks, where it’s stored at -1 ̊C. Freedom Brewery has a minimum maturation period of 4 weeks; this improves both the beer’s flavour profiles and naturally increases its stability, removing the need for chemical intervention. The verb ‘Lagerun’ is German for ‘to store’ – ironic as the majority of mass produced ‘lagers’ are brewed within days, with little or no maturation time at all.    Freedom Brewery sterile triple filters its beers to remove any remaining yeast and protein cells. This is instead of pasteurisation which, whilst being a cheaper process, carries the risk of ruining the beer’s natural flavours. Freedom’s first sterile filtration uses diatomaceous earth in contrast to isinglass, which is a substance obtained from the swim bladders of fish. As a result, all Freedom Beers are certified by the Vegan Society.","http://www.freedombeer.com/","1995","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zgCDhX/upload_0hOLyo-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zgCDhX/upload_0hOLyo-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/zgCDhX/upload_0hOLyo-large.png","deleted","Deleted","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","5430 Shiloh Forest Dr","Midlothian","Texas","76065","321-745-9819","32.517917","-96.923991","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","","United States","USA","","","","",""

"basAdv","Funkwerks","In 2007 Gordon Schuck’s recipe design and brewing skills resulted in a gold medal-winning Saison at the National Homebrew Competition. Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.     Saisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.     Funkwerks’ two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.     Funkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm. Brewery tours are given Saturdays at 2pm.     Funkwerks is currently distributed in:  Colorado:  American Eagle Distributing and C.R.

Our Brewery is located in the heart of Oakland Park’s new Culinary Arts District. The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida’s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.    You can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida.

"SY2b6E","Furthermore Beer","Furthermore bought a building way back in 2005 with the hopes of shoe-stringing together an undersized, Frankenstein-style brewery. The reason for so lofty a goal was of course to cheaply serve the more important purpose of the business--getting beer to the beer drinker, putting bottles on the shelf. However, even “cheap” was expensive to us. Pinching pennies and moving cautiously wasn’t helping us reach our self imposed deadline of Summer of 2006. Then we met the good folks at Sand Creek Brewing Co (Black River Falls, WI) who agreed to bring us on as customers, allowing us to use their facility to get the beer brewed. We were thus able to skip the hard lessons of construction pitfalls and went straight to filling stainless steel tanks with beer.     The scrape-together building and used equipment model was then blacked out from the “Phase 1” section of the business plan. Aran went on the road to be hands on at Sand Creek; Chris went on the road to sell beer. We have since acquired another property in Spring Green (known affectionately as the Shitty Barn), and we have often been heard threatening to build a brewery on this site, sometimes quite convincingly. But “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” seems to be the winning adage. So until we break it, we won’t likely fix our present model.     So that is the back story--the mental seasoning for your next sip of Furthermore Beer. Fair warning to the newcomer: those who like our beers always seem to find at least one to stick in the “hate” column—ant that’s always one that someone else places in the “love” column with a glittery heart sticker next to it. So remember, if you have distaste for one of our beers, it could our failings, or it could be your poor upbringing and resulting prejudices--so hate with an open mind.","http://www.furthermorebeer.com/","2005","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JuFsla/upload_dFOuLs-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JuFsla/upload_dFOuLs-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/JuFsla/upload_dFOuLs-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","525 East Madison Street","Spring Green","Wisconsin","53588","608-588-3300","43.18111","-90.072391","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","","United States","USA","","","PO Box 776","http://www.furthermorebeer.com/mailing-list",""

"oN5ry0","Geaghan Brothers Brewing","In the spring of 2010, Larry and Peter Geaghan began exploring the idea of expanding operations at Geaghan's Pub to include a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Maine.  Driven by a desire for a quality, local product that would complement and diversify the already existing pub's style and reputation, Larry and Peter knew they would have to focus on producing a high quality product if it was going to be a success.  Knowing his beer knowledge and passion for the family business in which he grew up, Larry and Peter soon brought Larry's son Andrew into the conversation.  Beginning in a consulting roll, Andrew soon decided it was time to come back into the fold and asked his father and uncle for an opportunity to rejoin the family business in a full-time position.  In the coming year as business at the pub rolled on and continued to grow, so too did the brewery project.  Moving from an idea spoken about “off the clock” to a plan developed in a weekly owner's meeting, Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company began to take shape.  The project received a major boost in the most unlikely of circumstances when Larry, attending a local funeral, made contact with Sarah Courtney, a woman who grew up with Larry's oldest son Thomas.  Sarah and her husband Jason had spent the past 15 years working full-time in brewpub and microbrewery settings.  Jason had progressed from homebrewer to assistant brewer to head brewer and in 2002 had a very successful showing at the Great American Beer Festival, receiving the brewpub category brewmaster of the year honors.  As Larry, Peter and Andrew continued conversations and expressed their desire to build a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Jason and Sarah also expressed their interest in moving back to the Bangor area.  In time, with many conversations and meetings, both desires began to take shape.  With many options available to them, Jason and Sarah decided an opportunity to have a foundational and long-term impact on and relationship with a truly local brewery in Bangor, Maine was exactly what they were looking for.  In December 2011 the idea became a reality.  The Geaghan Family, together with award winning brewer Jason Courtney, have begun pouring pints of locally craft brewed beer from Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company exclusively at Geaghan's Pub.","http://www.geaghanspub.com","2011","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_lnNlJi-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_lnNlJi-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/jmyqSv/upload_lnNlJi-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","570 Main Street","Bangor","Maine","04401","207-945-3730","44.786998","-68.777343","Y","N","N","Y","brewpub","Brewpub","US","","United States","USA","","","","",""
"rqVDmz","Geaux Brewing","Geaux started in a garage…like most startups—in the summer of 2011. Except, it wasn't a garage in someone's house but rather in Jeremy's business. With concrete floors and roll up doors, it was the perfect place to brew beer—and no spouses would be ticked that their kitchen or home was getting trashed in the process. The reason for wanting to ""home"" brew? Because the Friday beer parties at his business were starting to rack up some serious expenses. After all, we wanted to drink the good stuff and 22oz. bombers ain't cheap. So, Jeremy got the crazy idea (as he often does) to figure out a way to make beer so that we didn't have to spend so much money on other people's beer.     The problem was…where to start? Jeremy knew he wanted to brew beer but the reality was that with so many home brewers out there—each with their own opinion on how to do things—it was going to be a challenge to corral and sift through the information he needed to get started and actually brew good beer.     After a few ""test"" batches that yielded sub-standard beer, he got serious and started researching and researching and doing even more research until that first ""golden"" batch came through. Eventually, the challenge went from brewing good beer to brewing good beer consistently. Again, with more research, he figured it out. Then, he got the idea. ""What about other new or rookie home brewers out there? Aren't they facing the same problems I am? Wouldn't they and new home brewers want a convenient location to get it hands-on information about brewing?"" At that moment, Geaux went from a hobby to a serious endeavor to bring professional-level brewing techniques to the home brewing community. Then, the REAL fun began.    Going from a ""home"" brewing operation to a commercial brewery (which is required if you plan to brew anywhere outside of home…even if you don't sell it (oops.)) was a bit more than anyone ever envisioned. After a year of plodding away at paperwork, construction, and using up every ounce of goodwill from family and friends, the Geaux brewery and tap room opened up to the public on October 19th, 2013.","http://geauxbrewing.com","","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DaJPkB/upload_xfHLsD-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DaJPkB/upload_xfHLsD-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/DaJPkB/upload_xfHLsD-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-10-01 14:27:53","12031 Northup Way","Bellevue","WA","98005","425-505-8765","47.6304115","-122.1797945","Y","N","N","Y","tasting","Tasting Room","US","","United States","USA","","Mon:  4:00pm - 8:00pm Tue:  4:00pm - 8:00pm Wed:  4:00pm - 8:00pm Thu:  3:00pm - 9:00pm Fri:  3:00pm - 9:00pm Sat:  12:00pm - 8:00pm Sun:  1:00pm - 6:00pm  Last call 15 min prior to close.

"REDaIN","Gentle Ben's Brewing Company","Gentle Ben’s has been on this block since 1971 and has been brewing award winning brews since 1991. The original house was located under what is now the lobby of the Marriott Hotel. Built in 1908 as a private residence for the Hamilton family, over the years it served as the University president’s house, a boarding house and home to several fraternities. The name Gentle Ben’s was chosen through a contest and the winner was a University professor who thought the manager looked like Dan Haggerty from the T.V. show Grizzly Adams whose co-star was a bear named Gentle Ben. That show was based on a man who roamed parts of Northern California in the 1920s and 30s. He had two bears, Benjamin Franklin and Martha Washington. Martha was a mean bear by people standards and had to be kept chained to a stake. The other was gentle and was free to roam, hence Gentle Ben.Gentle Ben’s Brewing Company of Tucson      Brewing began in 1991 when I bought the business and installed what, at the time, was the only brewery in Tucson. We started with three beers; Tucson Blonde, Red Cat Amber and Copperhead Pale Ale, all still brewed today and joined by five other styles.","http://gentlebens.com/","1971","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/w4ubfN/upload_pzynTn-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/w4ubfN/upload_pzynTn-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/w4ubfN/upload_pzynTn-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","865 E.

"zNaGRX","Gnarly Barley Brewing","Originating from the home of Zac and Cari Caramonta, Gnarly Barley Brewing got its start in a crowded garage, amongst the presence of two fat cats and a halfpipe. After being exposed to great craft beer, Zac began homebrewing, first, as an investigation into the brewing process, then with the objective to create beer equally as exceptional as the beers that had inspired him in the first place. Not long after, their garage took a form similar to a science lab and brewing became an addiction.    Gnarly Barley’s homebrewed beer debuted at the New Orleans on Tap beer festival with the Korova Milk Porter and the Hoppopotamus IPA. Gaining positive feedback through local beer festivals and finding many comrades in the local brewing community, Zac and Cari sought to open a microbrewery, giving Zac a better excuse to indulge in his obsession.    Established in 2011, Gnarly Barley Brewing is located in a 10,500 square foot facility in Hammond, Louisiana and consists of a two-vessel 30bbl Brewhouse, one hot and one cold liquor tank, four fermentation vessels, one bright beer tank and a whole lot of passion for craft beer.","http://gnarlybeer.com/","2011","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vIikZV/upload_FgB4gF-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vIikZV/upload_FgB4gF-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vIikZV/upload_FgB4gF-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-10-29 14:33:42","1709 Corbin Road","Hammond","LA","70403","985-318-0723","30.4972751","-90.4785871","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","","United States","USA","","","","",""

I came up with a process that allows me to get a rather large amount of body, equivalent to the body of an IPA, but with the finish of a light beer.”    “We’re bringing beer to the market that ale drinkers will enjoy, because they’re going to be different and flavorful, and we’ll grab some of the mainstream drinkers. Take my son,” Duenwald says. “He’s in his 30s, living in Seattle. He’ll start the night out drinking a Mac & Jack’s or a Mirror Pond. He might even have two of them. But when they’re having one of their all-night fun sessions, they’ll switch to drinking Bud Light.

Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).    We took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It’s pretty fun to have someone you don’t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn’t set out to start a business, the business just found us.     “Once in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right” Robert Hunter    We wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners.     Good People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company….to be good people.     In September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together. It was a long, frustrating, and tiring process….but it was flat worth every bit of it all.    So if you are looking for something made in small batches with high quality ingredients and pride, please give us a shot.    The Brewery  We brew on a two kettle, combi-tank and brew kettle, 20 bbl system manufactured by New World Systems. New World is now Premier Stainless and Rob and Alan are two of the best in the business.    We have three 20 bbl fermenters and one 20 bbl bright tank.","http://www.goodpeoplebrewing.com/","2007","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fib7Lb/upload_l7sTg1-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fib7Lb/upload_l7sTg1-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/fib7Lb/upload_l7sTg1-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","114 14th Street South","Birmingham","Alabama","35223","","33.50713","-86.811894","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","2007","United States","USA","","Taproom Hours  Wednesday: 3pm - 8pm  Thursday: 3pm - 8pm  Friday: 3pm - 8pm  Saturday: 1pm - 4pm","","",""

"S2n5TB","Goose Island Beer Company","When the first Goose Island Brewpub opened its doors in 1988, domestic, mass-produced beer was deeply ingrained in Midwestern culture. The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he’d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes – John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.    The key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process – while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers’ tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island’s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers – and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.    It turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island’s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone’s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.    Today, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","http://www.gooseisland.com/","1995","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_w0f4W1-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_w0f4W1-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/APW1BC/upload_w0f4W1-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-09-11 10:33:51","1800 West Fulton Street","Chicago","Illinois","60612","1-800-466-7363","41.887107","-87.6720969","Y","N","N","N","production","Production Facility","US","1995","United States","USA","","","","",""

Enthusiasts continue to bring in glasses, pictures, and artifacts from the turn-of-the century brewery. One woman found half of the original sign that hung on the Ionia and Michigan Street building—as she was cleaning her great uncle's inherited barn. The sign was facing down and being used as a shelf.    In a different incident, the brewery was called by archeologists digging at a Michigan training camp for soldiers during the Spanish-American War.

"SAtbDP","Grand Ridge Brewery","The Grand Ridge Brewery is situated in a small country town in the Gippsland region of Victoria, in Australia, called Mirboo North. The site was chosen by Grand Ridge for its exceptional water quality for beer making, given its position on the top of the mountains in the Strzelecki ranges. After extensive product testing to achieve the highest standards in pure beer, Grand Ridge commenced brewing in June 1989.         Grand Ridge is at the top of the list in high quality beers. All the beers are produced to exceptionally high standards of flavour and purity, with no added chemicals or preservatives.  This typically results in a far less severe hangover, if any at all.    At Grand Ridge the quality of the beer is never compromised. The mission at Grand Ridge is always to make the best beer in the world. Grand Ridge is a 100% Australian, family owned company.    The quality of the Grand Ridge beers has been recognized with over 160 Australian and International beer awards. In 2002 at the Australian and International beer Awards Grand Ridge won 29 medals. This was more than any other brewery in the world including all 19 countries represented.    In 2003 Grand Ridge won 21 medals including 6 best of class winners (double any other brewery in the world). In 2002, 2003 and 2005 Grand Ridge won Victoria's best beer for the Premiers Trophy along with 62 other international medals. Grand Ridge has won the title for Australia's best Lager, Ale, Dark, Stout, Wheat and Light beer categories. This trend has continued through to 2011 where Grand Ridge won 12 more International medals.         Grand Ridge was chosen to be the exclusive beer supplier for the Royal Melbourne Show in 2007 and 2008 and is currently the preferred supplier to the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre.","http://www.grand-ridge.com.au/","1989","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/XxRA3s/upload_UV7bgM-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/XxRA3s/upload_UV7bgM-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/XxRA3s/upload_UV7bgM-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","1 Baromi Road","Mirboo North","Victoria","3781","03 5668 2222","-38.4009674","146.1627082","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","AU","","Australia","AUS","36","","","",""

The original 1903 Bolick’s bottling plant still stands as and within the brick walls along the left side of the building and lobby interior. Come celebrate with us 110 years of beverage production and bottling onsite!     History: in December 2012, Mastroeli-MacNeil Equity Investments financed the purchase of this 31,690 square foot configuration of two warehouses, situated on 2.08 acres contiguous to Downtown Granite Falls. A panoramic view of the Blue Ridge Mountains runs the rear of the building. The owners financed a painstaking build-out, and are proud of the adaptive reuse of this warehouse/manufacturing space into a supper club, eatery, and old-style ""watering hole.""     The Brewery: GFB is a 30BBL/(40BBL) craft beer production facility. We brew onsite and within sight while you indulge your senses in our Southern Gastropub restaurant and attached Tasting Room. Our brewpub features a wraparound 103-foot-long tasting counter, copper/penny-topped wine bar, and serves as a world-class music venue. Eclectic artifacts dress the spaces for those with an itch for the odd or unique.    The owners of Granite Falls Brewing Company invite you to visit our site, indulge in an experience that is In A Glass By Itself, partake of laughter, fellowship and community, lo and behold what we unearthed between the walls and specimens of the original Granite Bottling Works bottles.

Our shared love of food and beer propelled us to start an underground beer tasting movement during which we hosted a series of 7 beer tasting events over the course of a 13 months. We may be the new kids on the Prescott scene, but GMB brings ten years of brewing experience to the table. From the farmlands of Vermont to the mountains of Alaska; the homelands of Idaho and now the high deserts of Prescott!     GMB opened the doors on the brewery and taproom in August 2012. By small operation, we mean SMALL. Not micro. We're talking about nanobrewing here, folks. We're a grassroots endeavor that began in a garage and garnered fast support from the community.     We pride ourselves on high-quality unpretentious beer. We like to brew traditional styles as well as creative twists on the traditional. Inspired by the local landscape and community, we look forward to experimenting with local ingredients (wheat berries, juniper berries, prickly pear fruit) and becoming part of the local flavor of Prescott. Beer education is part of what we do: styles, processes, ingredients, and the magical pairing between beer and food. Why? Because this is all part of celebrating the simpler things in life: good food, good friends, good beer.","http://www.granitemountainbrewing.com/","2010","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qtLQ7F/upload_LWdiOR-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qtLQ7F/upload_LWdiOR-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/qtLQ7F/upload_LWdiOR-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","123 N Cortez St","Prescott","Arizona","86301","(928) 778-5535","34.5427831","-112.4686784","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","2010","United States","USA","","Wed - Thu: 4:00 pm - 9:00 pm  Fri: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm  Sat: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm  Sun: 1:00 pm - 6:00 pm","","",""

Our 7 barrel stainless-steel brew system was custom manufactured for us by JV Northwest, Inc. in Oregon and is now housed in a separate building directly behind the restaurant.     Our seven barrel stainless steel brewhouse produces a wide range of ales and lagers year round using the finest imported and domestic ingredients available. Our commitment to quality, consistency, and continued brewing knowledge has garnered us several awards through the years and is evident in the final product—the fresh pint poured off our taps.     We are currently producing 350 barrels of hand crafted beer per year. This works out to approximately 10,850 gallons, or 86,800 pints of beer per year! We pride ourselves on creating small batches of hand crafted ales and lagers covering a variety of beer styles.

Well, for us, there's a lot of anticipation in tasting a new beer. The way the foam settles in a glass of dark stout, or the raining effect you can see in a pint of IPA served on nitro... they remind us sometimes of the expectant feeling we get watching powerful storms roll in over the mountains in our home town of Colorado Springs. Yes, we tend to wax poetic over a pint glass. I told you we love beer. But anyway, that was part of the inspiration. The other part was our beloved half Husky, half Aussie brewdog, Storm. He's a little... wild. Like our beers.      We hope you'll find the same passion for drinking our beers as we do for making them. Come in and see us, we'll be pleased to pour you a pint.

"AlhRYb","Greenbush Brewing Co","Good ideas often start over beer. Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.    So with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. ""We're on to something"", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.    This led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our ""anything goes"" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.    Now, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.    Stop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","http://www.greenbushbrewing.com/","","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QJRQhZ/upload_999gvA-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QJRQhZ/upload_999gvA-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QJRQhZ/upload_999gvA-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","5885 Sawyer Rd.","Sawyer","Michigan","49125","269-405-1076","41.8856286","-86.5946671","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","","United States","USA","","Sunday - Thursday: 12-8  Friday and Saturday: 12-10","","",""

"1irs0u","Greenport Harbor Brewing Company","The idea began a long time ago over … well … a pretty terrible beer.  You see we (John from NY and Rich from Boston) met in college and had to drink what beer we could afford in those days.    As the years went by, the better the beer we consumed, the more we were consumed by it.  We tried every beer imaginable.  We read about beer. We talked about beer. We began making our own beer.  And finally we started talking and dreaming about opening a brewery on the North Fork.    In the Spring of 2008 the dream became a reality when Rich heard about an old firehouse for sale in the Village of Greenport.  Driven by thirst more than brains, we bought the building in the middle of what has been called a Global Economic Meltdown.  Next we started the renovation.  Did we mention Global Economic Meltdown?  We tried to do most of the work ourselves and luckily got a lot of help from some good friends and family.   The promise of beer can be powerful. Our luck continued when on a snowy January day, with no roof on our brewery, we got a visit from DJ Swanson and his 2 young children. No one in their right mind would have joined us. DJ did and agreed to be our new head brewer. In April with roof replaced, windows installed, and drains dug, our brew house arrived and the idea of making Greenport Harbor beer began. Four months later in July of 2009 we were officially shipping (hand truck and family cars) our beer.    Today our beer is served in over 200 places on Long Island (thank you Justin) and NYC.    We’re proud to say that since summer of 2009 we have been singled out for nearly every beer we have brewed from the Village Voice to the Tasting Table to TimeOut NY to Newsday to NY Examiner to Wall Street Journal to countless beer and food blogs.  We have a total of 13 employees if you include our forklift and delivery truck, which we do. We hope to add to this number in the next few months when we grow by 66 and 2/3’s percent by adding 2 new tanks. We are the only local brewery that brews 100% of our beer.

We don’t want to blow-out your palate, we want you to explore the hidden flavors and understand the complexities of the taste.    We love beer. We want you to love beer.    We will focus on crafting beers between 4.5% and 7.0% ABV. Our goal is a well-balanced, well-crafted, session beer. We’ll do the hop-thing too, but always with an exciting and culinary-focused angle.    Here’s the other thing. We’re adventurous. San Diego is the brew capital of the world (are we exaggerating here… NO!) There’s lots of great brewers. We found a few of them and held them down, twisted their arm really hard and asked them to brew something new and out there for us. Then, we found a few chefs who thought brewing was good sport. We helped them with the technical stuff and set them loose with the brew equipment.    You’ll see their brew in our taproom…they may have other gigs in the city, and we support their efforts there too. Beer is beer. Drink it here. Drink it there.

Leased for 9,000 years in 1759 by Arthur Guinness at £45 per year, St. James's Gate has been the home of Guinness ever since. It became the largest brewery in Ireland in 1838, and was the largest in the world in 1914, covering 64 acres. Although no longer the largest brewery in the world, it is still the largest brewer of stout in the world. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the brewery owned most of the buildings in the surrounding area, including many streets of housing for brewery employees, and offices associated with the brewery. The brewery also made all of its own power using its own power plant.

In 1929 the dairy closed, so the brewery was able to expand production into other types of beers: Bock, Export, Pilsner and Stout Ale. In 1950 they established their first bottling plant. Up until then the beer was only being sold in kegs. Between 1968 and 1990 they've been expanding by taking over breweries in the south of the Netherlands and North of France. In the 1990's they've started modernising the brewery. In 2010 this modernisation process was completed when they inaugurated their new kegigng hall.

"AGRvvY","Harpoon Brewery","We started the Harpoon Brewery in 1986 because—like today—we loved beer and wanted more quality choices.      There was only one problem: we were beer lovers, not brewers. We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn’t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.      We still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.","http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/","1986","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RzvedX/upload_6ztnSI-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RzvedX/upload_6ztnSI-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/RzvedX/upload_6ztnSI-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-10-06 15:45:55","336 Ruth Carney Drive","Windsor","Vermont","05089","802-674-5491","43.5130201","-72.4016913","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","1986","United States","USA","","","","",""

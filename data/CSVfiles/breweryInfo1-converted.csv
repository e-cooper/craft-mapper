And those textbooks are right; especially about the 1791 part.    Today, in Franklin County, Vermont, Army veteran Steve Gagner is honoring his home state and passion – brewing great beer – with 14th Star Brewing Co.    14th Star is Steve’s 1,200-square-foot nanobrewery on Lower Newton Street, in St. Albans City.    Nanobreweries make less than four-barrel batches, and as of your eyes hitting this paragraph, there are still less than 100 nanobreweries in America.    What makes 14th Star stand out? Well, it’s about the only brewery in Vermont that’s located above Burlington. Period.    But that’s not it. Not entirely.    You see – this is your beer. Oh, sure, Steve plans on starting you off with one-barrel batches of pale ale, brown ale, and Belgian white. There will be more, of course, but that’s up to you. So tell Steve what style beer you want in your 14th Star growler at: steve@14thstarbrewing.com.  On our end, we are readying to open our doors. Our goal is this July. (Check out our Pint of Progress on our home page.)    We can’t wait to watch you let your hair down and lift your glass, Vermont. We’ll enjoy that. And remember – this is your beer.

"5R4Akp","3 Sheeps Brewing Company","All families have their stories: tales of grandparents and great-grandparents and the incredible things they accomplished, or lived through, or overcame. My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.    Back in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.    I grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife’s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.    This is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality. Thank you to all those who have helped me get here.    - Grant Pauly, 3 Sheeps Brewing","http://www.3sheepsbrewing.com/","2012","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hw7H52/upload_c8CRE6-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hw7H52/upload_c8CRE6-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hw7H52/upload_c8CRE6-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-10-06 15:44:18","1327 North 14th Street","Sheboygan","Wisconsin","53081","920-395-3583","43.7590398","-87.7229469","Y","Y","N","N","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","","","","","",""

"1mRL8J","350 Brewing Company","The 350 Brewing Company has spawned from the ashes of our failed Collegiate careers at Northern Illinois University. Let me explain. 350 Augusta Ave. was our address in Dekalb, IL. At the time, your founders Todd and Erik spent more time on projects like way below average punk rock bands in the attic, and a Hardcore Wrestling Federation called WCVF (this took place in our kitchen), instead of focusing on classes like Humanities 227 in DuSable Hall. I mean, have you ever choke slammed one of your best friends into an oven pre-heated to ""550 degrees""? Well i have, and that was just a random Wednesday night. This raw energy (stupidity) and creativity is what eventually drew us to the Craft Beer scene. That’s what craft beer is…a creative and fresh twist on a beverage that has been mass produced and shoved down our throats for much too long (carefully stepping down from soapbox). Why not name our Brewery after the point in our life when we were most creative? Well…..we did. It was during these times we were also introduced to good, quality beer.    Once NIU had enough of our shenanigans, Erik went on to continue his education while I submerged myself into the cesspool known as corporate America. I feel dirty just talking about it. Over the last decade, my soul has been slowly rotting and exiting my body so there was a need for this creative juice to be squeezed once again. Since wrestling and punk rock was now out of the question, brewing beer quickly became that much needed release from the Groundhog Day that had become the norm for us. Erik like most homebrewers started out brewing with extract several years ago and quickly rose to the challenge of all-grain batches. Erik, the 350 Head brewer, has been very successful when entering brewing competitions walking away with multiple awards for his Porter and Patersbier. Myself on the other hand have had a love for flavorful craft beer for many moons, and once I learned of Erik’s brewing expertise years ago, I too became emerged in this brewing lifestyle. It was a match made in heaven. Erik brewed awesome beer, and I was awesome at drinking and sharing that beer!!!     From that point on things just sort of clicked and for the last 2 years Erik and I have been researching and concocting this master plan of opening a brewery. The time has come. We want all of you to enjoy this journey with us. Tinley Park has always been our #1 choice for the 350 Brewing Company. Downtown Tinley Park embodies the spirit of 350. With great electricity in the downtown area, coupled with an amazing artistic feel, will definitely pair well with our vision of always making sure a visit to our brewery is an interesting experience. We feel Tinley Park is ready for a neighborhood brewery. It really was an easy decision based on Tinley Park’s sense of community and passion for supporting local products.    We are looking forward to joining the family of incredible Illinois Brewers. We should all thank our lucky stars that we live in a state with such high quality Breweries.","http://350Brewing.com","2013","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W3pb09/upload_pRw6FS-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W3pb09/upload_pRw6FS-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/W3pb09/upload_pRw6FS-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-25 13:36:01","7144 183rd St","Tinley Park","Illinois","60477","","41.5593734","-87.7911748","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","","","","","",""

Granted that war and blockades are not the ideal conditions to start a company, alongside everyone telling them they were mad to even consider it, they went ahead with it anyway. They decided that brewing a good beer for a great country was what they wanted to do the most.    When 961 Beer officially began brewing they were one of the smallest breweries in the world, and the only microbrewery in the Middle East (and still are).

"gaVq6l","Aass Brewery","Aass Brewery was established in 1834 and is the oldest brewery in Norway today. It is located in the city of Drammen, approximately 25 miles south of our capital, Oslo. You will spot it at the banks of the Drammen River at the very same place as it has been since 1834. The annual production of beer is aprox. 10 mill liter (85 000 barrels), and together with the production of 18 mill liters of soft drinks and mineralwater it gives employment to approximately 150 people.  You may wonder how we got our name ? It was a young fellow with the name Poul Lauritz Aass that bought the brewery in 1860. Since then it has been in the same family, and is today run by the 4th generation of Aass. (By the way - A real Norwegian viking would pronounce it Ouse)  The brewery is proud of its history. To us the quality of what we produce has always been and always will be the main issue. In 1516, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria established a law admitting only malted barley, hops yeast, and water as ingredients in the production of beer. The law is known as the purity law and Aass Brewery is still loyal to Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria. In Norway the brewery is known for outstanding quality and large number of different beer types.","http://www.aass.no","","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TGtEbk/upload_fgq5cE-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TGtEbk/upload_fgq5cE-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/TGtEbk/upload_fgq5cE-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Ole Steensgt. 10 Postboks 1530","Drammen","","","47-32-26-60-00","59.731819","10.190885","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","NO","Norway","NOR","578","","","","",""

In its first year, the brewery produced 1,500 barrels of beer. We had no idea what we started. Customers loved our beer! By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100-seat brew pub) and moved up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand.      We brew over 151,000 barrels of beer and 9,100 barrels of root beer in our state-of-the-art brewing facility. Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews.    We are privately owned and operated by local shareholders, many who have been with us since day one.    Abita uses only the finest ingredients – British and North American malted barley, German and American yeast strains, Pacific Northwest hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs.

We've been heavily influenced by so many beers particularly by breweries from the 1800's that have now long-since closed their doors. Heritage is important to us and all our beers are made with a definitive nod to the brewers and breweries of former times. If we can develop great beer and give people a history lesson at the same time we would be two very happy brewers!    We regularly produce a range of four core beers (North, South, West and East) and North Pole is brewed for the festive season. We also brew a new limited edition beer each month, produced in small batches and aimed the drinker wanting something just a little bit different.

The most common approach used by the major breweries is a ‘scientific one’.  All stages of the brewing process are closely monitored to ensure a consistent, if tasteless product.  Computers and other high tech equipment are more in control than the brewer himself.  With this approach you get ‘scientific’ beer.  The other approach is a more artistic one, while still respecting basic laws of science, and the need for spotless cleanliness.  That’s the approach we plan to always take at Aftershock.  At the risk of losing an undetectable amount of consistency, the result is beer with much more character, subtle nuances, and awesome flavor.

"krIs45","Alaskan Brewing Company","Alaska has a rich history of brewing. From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.    In 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.    Marcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. ""Why not start a brewery?"" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.    Maybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.    While researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed.

"8tHhXL","Amager Bryghus","Our small microbrewery is located in a picturesque industrial neighbourhood near the Danish capital, Copenhagen, and the airport in the city of Taarnby. There is absolute no doubt that we run the safest brewing enterprise in the country as our premises used to be an air-raid shelter. Our premises have also been used for storing bibles, hence reigns an atmosphere of divine tranquillity only otherwise found in Belgian monasteries. Well...     Founders of the brewery are the two friends and dedicated home brewers Mr. Morten Valentin Lundsbak and Mr. Jacob Storm, who since the opening of the brewery have achieved diplomas of their skills as they have become Diploma Brewers at the Scandinavian School of Brewing.     It is our ambition to cater to all beer lovers - every time, which is why we only use pure ingredients during the brewing process. We make no shortcuts by using artificial additives to speed or help the processes. Furthermore, we have deliberately chosen neither to pasteurize nor filter our beer as we would like to preserve the best possible flavours and aromas.     We allow the beer to mature completely in the bottle before releasing it to the market. This process implies that a natural sediment may remain in the bottle. This sediment can easily be consumed, but if an aesthetic beer experience is desired, pour the beer gently into the glass without the sediment. And preferably use a high pour to get the full and frothy head as well as to release all the pleasant aromas from this well-brewed beer from Amager Bryghus.","http://www.amagerbryghus.dk/","","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LOKnrY/upload_6MBK5R-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LOKnrY/upload_6MBK5R-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/LOKnrY/upload_6MBK5R-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Fuglebækvej 2 C","","Kastrup","2770","+45 32 50 62 00 ‎","55.624252","12.595661","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","DK","Denmark","DNK","208","","","","",""

The original scope called for a modest 7 bbl brew house with tanks enough to manage 2000 bbl of production per year. After much re-thinking and soul-searching the brewery was increased in size to 15 bbl and room to grow to 10,000 bbls production per year.

"TaDE9V","Andrew's Brewing Company","Andy Hazen is a workhorse of a brewer. From start to finish, he is a one-man operation. The former cabinetmaker is also a self-reliant Mainer through and through. He was originally an all-grain homebrewer who decided to take it to the next level when his friends expressed interest in his beers. He designed the 12-barrel brewing system himself and enlisted a local welder to help put it together. Hazen notes that when you live in Maine, you have to find some service to provide to others in order to survive. For him, brewing is the service he provides to his local community. Located in the rolling hills of Lincolnville, Maine, Andrew's is housed in a renovated farmhouse next to Hazen's home. Finding the brewery is more than half the battle. Have no fear, however, as everyone knows about Andrew's. Also, be aware that due to some thieving souls, the brewery no longer has any signage to announce its existence to the visiting public. The only indication that a brewery exists in the farmhouse are the occasional keg deliveries in Hazen's front yard. And Hazen hasn't been quick to replace the sign either. While he welcomes visitors, you have to remember to clear a path for the busy brewer. Like many other unsung small brewers, running his 5OO-barrel per year brewery is a seven day a week operation for Hazen. Watching Hazen run the brewery is a little like watching Willy Wonka run the Chocolate Factory. When I visit him during a bottling day, Hazen runs between the bottling line and the packaging supplies in a hurried yet methodical manner. He stands up bottles on the line, starts the machine, slides his way across the brewhouse to the packaging materials, and hand assembles the six-packs that will hold the soon-to-be bottled beer. Andrew's beer is straightforward, unassuming and entirely enjoyable. His product line includes the St. Nick Porter, the Northern Brown Ale, the English Pale Ale, and the summer seasonal Ruby's Golden Ale. A celebration of the Amarillo hop, Hazen's English Pale Ale is a delightfully balanced product that neither over or underwhelms the palate.  from beerscribe.com","http://www.mainebrewersguild.org/andrews.php","1992","N","","","","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-08-25 19:12:47","353 High St","Lincolnville","Maine","04849","(207) 763-3305","44.3139494","-69.1336523","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","","","1992","Mon:  7:00am - 4:00pm Tue:  7:00am - 4:00pm Wed:  7:00am - 4:00pm Thu:  7:00am - 4:00pm Fri:  7:00am - 4:00pm Sat:  9:00am - 10:00am  Mon - Fri: 7:00 am - 4:00 pm  Sat: 9:00 am - 10:00 am","",""

"5tw2Iw","Angel City Brewing","Angel City Brewery is excited to be part of the brewing renaissance of Downtown LA by bringing old-world, small-batch, craft brewing to the new world of the expanding Arts District. We are committed to the continued growth and revitalization of our neighborhood by being an interactive and supportive partner to the arts and business communities, as well as the burgeoning craft beer movement in Los Angeles.    Angel City Brewing was founded in 1997. Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA’s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great city a great brewery.    On January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.    Since January 2012, we’ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.    In February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out. In addition to the neighborhood cuisine, our parking lot has become a hot spot for food trucks, with one parked outside nearly every night we’re open. On May 5th, 2013 we had our grand opening with our first ever Heritage Festival. We’re now seven days a week for brewery tours and tastings, and we have full roster of weekly events.","http://www.angelcitybrewing.com/","1997","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0ZIlVA/upload_6I5iTE-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0ZIlVA/upload_6I5iTE-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/0ZIlVA/upload_6I5iTE-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","216 S Alameda St","Los Angeles","California","90013","310-329-8881","34.0466054","-118.2378181","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","","","1997","","",""

Named after the Arkansas state flower, the 8,500 square foot, 250 seat brewpub will be a celebration of all things local, from the food to the ingredients in the beer.  The 10 barrel brewing system will be the birthplace of many varied styles and flavors, with an eye to the emerging trends coming from the coasts and Colorado. Fayetteville can expect the traditional favorites, such as pale ales and ESB's, but should also be ready for tantilising and challenging specials and seasonals.

Earthly beers are brewed somewhat similar ways and have a common process.  Alien Head Beer is actually brewed in a special process that is unlike other breweries and delivers a taste that is out of this world!

Interestingly, the Auburn Alehouse is located just 1/10th of a mile from the original Auburn Brewery, which brewed for thirsty Auburnites from 1855 until 1908. You may stop by for the ale, but you’ll find the food is a star attraction as well.

"eqCbpj","Ayinger Brewery","The Ayinger Brewery (pronounced ""eye-ing-gr""; German: Brauerei Aying) is a medium-sized German brewery located in Aying, Bavaria, about 25 km from Munich. Approximately 10% of Ayinger beers are exported, mainly to Italy, the United States, and the rest of Europe. Ayinger beers have been frequent award winners in international beer competitions.    For some years, a range of beer was brewed under the Ayingerbrau name by Samuel Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, United Kingdom. Although the Ayinger logo was used, the recipes and range were different from those of the Ayinger Brewery. The arrangement ended in spring 2006, at which point Samuel Smith's rebranded the beers. Distribution of the Ayinger range of beer followed that summer. Because the Oktoberfest in Munich does not allow breweries outside its city limits to participate, Ayinger Brewery organizes many smaller festivals in the countryside around Munich.","http://en.ayinger-bier.de/","","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QKdFk2/upload_nCGsoa-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QKdFk2/upload_nCGsoa-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/QKdFk2/upload_nCGsoa-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-10-07 20:47:32","Münchner Straße 21","","Aying","D-85653","49080958890","","","Y","N","N","Y","brewpub","Brewpub","DE","Germany","DEU","276","","","","",""

The Triporteur beers are our point of departure and our basic beers. Besides those, we also launch a special beer line with once-off products.

"lAcrbq","Back Forty Beer Company","Back Forty is a micro brewery based out of Gadsden, Alabama. With 2 offerings currently distributed throughout the state, Back Forty is the only Alabama based brewery that can be found anywhere from Muscle Shoals to Mobile.    The name Back Forty Beer Company is basically a reference to the back 40 acres of the farm. Tradionally the ""Back 40"" of a farm is the most challenging to maintain, but also produces some of the best yields due to the rich content of the earth. Likewise, Alabama was one of the last States in The Union to update it's outdated beer laws (MS is the only one left), and now it's time to reap those yields.    The craft beer market in Alabama has a lot of room to grow, and we plan on doing everything we can to make that happen. Our main goal is to focus on the local community and support other small business owners while offering up our tasty flavors for the people of Alabama.     The company is founded in Alabama, and just about every aspect of this business is supported by Alabama based suppliers. We've worked with a Design firm out of Athens, AL on our label and logos, our attorney is in Birmingham, our accountant is in Dothan, AL, our shirts are printed in Huntsville and our Brewmaster is out of Montgomery, AL.     We've been working with Jamie Ray (A nationally recognized Brewmaster who has won several medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, CO), for over a year on our first offering, ""Naked Pig Pale Ale"". And we have several ideas in the works for additional year round offerings in the coming months. We're looking forward to producing some great beers that Alabamian's have never tasted before. Once things get up and running, we'll start releasing some seasonal offerings, one-time offerings, limited edition batches, etc. That's what we're really excited about.    The only aspect of this operation that isn't planted firmly in Alabama soil, is the production and packaging. We had to go to another craft brewery in a neighboring state for our first production batches. This is partially due to the enormous start-up costs associated with building a complete brewery operation from scratch. But it's also given us the opportunity to support another regional micro-brewery while we get up and running.","http://www.backfortybeer.com/","2009","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_Lw3eGZ-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_Lw3eGZ-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/KkUzjZ/upload_Lw3eGZ-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","200 North 6th St.","Gadsden","Alabama","35901","256-467-4912","34.015484","-86.005585","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","","","2009","","",""

I give you this warning: Don’t drink bad whiskey and don’t do as I have done.”    While he doesn’t think highly of his great-great uncle, Sean Smith, Bad Tom co-owner, has turned his relative’s evil deeds into a namesake for a local brewery. “My penance is to make good beer for all the bad whiskey he drank,” Smith quips.    After talking and sharing his great-great uncle’s story with Charles Boucher, co-owner and master brewer, they decided to change the name to Bad Tom Smith Brewing.    Boucher’s beer list includes the flagship Bad Tom Smith, a reddish brown ale.

Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California.

Stephen was in Europe doing research in molecular biology and experienced its beer culture that lead to his mid-career crisis.  He started writing about beer, and then tried to open a brewery in Arlon, Belgium but that faltered.  He then formed the first beer-of-the-month club in Europe, Beer Around the World.  Importing beer into Luxembourg, boxing it up and shipping it within the EU.  One supplier of his beers was Wolfgang Stark of Haus de 131 Biere.  Wolfgang imported beer from all over the world. He supplied Ngoma from Togo, Flame from New Zealand, and Lapin Kulta from Finland.   One day Wolfgang asked Stephen if he would like to make a beer in Germany and using an American marketing theme.  It took Stephen just a second to say yes and a day to come up with The Raven.  The new company was registered in Baltimore and the new beer was eventually produced in Nagold, Germany and called in honor of Baltimore's Edgar Allan Poe The Raven Special Lager.","http://www.ravenbeer.com/home.html","1998","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dwroV3/upload_l3JN59-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dwroV3/upload_l3JN59-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/dwroV3/upload_l3JN59-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","401 E. 30th St","Baltimore","Maryland","21218","410.321.1892","39.324338","-76.610422","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","","","","","",""

Decades of drinking beer – and specifically micro-brews – have contributed to Tom’s brewing pedigree. (Or so he says.)

"v21wKL","Barley and Vine Brewery","Since 2003, family and friends have come to know that initials on the bottle caps along with names of classic cars designate beers from the Barley and Vine Brewery.   Barley and Vine is becoming known for great quality ales, and at times going to extremes to provide the very best in beer.    From the first batch of beer, Rambler Red, brewing was destined for the garage or outdoors because of the huge mess and bad smell made in the kitchen. So, for the first four years Barley and Vine was making 5-gallon extract batches.  Barley and Vine began sharing the beers with friends and family looking for input and making corrections and changes when needed.  As time went by the brewing skill level and quality of the beer continued to improve.   Changing from 5-gallon extract batched to 10 gallon all-grain batches made a huge difference in the quality of the final product.    Barley and Vine is a nano brewery in the planning.  As we continue to build our business plan, determine a location, and perfect our recipes and processes we will do our best to keep people up to speed through this website, Facebook, and our blog.  The ultimate dream is to have a brewery and a brewpub.","http://www.barleyandvinebrewery.com/","2010","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WnA1GN/upload_gR2C7K-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WnA1GN/upload_gR2C7K-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/WnA1GN/upload_gR2C7K-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","","Franklin","Wisconsin","53132","260-388-1898","42.897482","-88.031191","Y","N","N","N","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","","","2010","","",""

"iWyq08","Barrel House Brewing Company","Established as a brewpub in 1995 in the historic Over-The-Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati, The BarrelHouse Brewing Company has since transitioned into a regionally distributed microbrewery offering an impressive selection of both innovative styles of ales and traditional lagers. Brewed and bottled in small batches with only honest ingredients, BarrelHouse beers are extremely fresh and exceptionally flavorful. Thank you for embracing our fiercely independent vision of a hand-crafted future for all! Operating as a brewpub from August 1995 until February 2005, The BarrelHouse Brewing Company recently relocated to our current location in the West End of downtown Cincinnati. We officially reopened with a completed expansion plan in April 2005. Our expansion included almost doubling our fermentation capacity as well as the addition of a brand new bottling line. Our first order of bottled beer hit Ohio area stores in June 2006 and we have subsequently begun to enter markets that were previously unavailable. The BarrelHouse Brewing Company brews on a 15 BBL brewhouse manufactured by Century. One BBL equals 31 gallons therefore; our beers are hand-crafted in 465 gallon batches. Our ales are ready after approximately fourteen days while our lagers are conditioned for upwards of six weeks. By brewing in small batches, our brewers are able to achieve an optimal level of quality control while creating a consistently flavorful product. While our brewing process is quite labor intensive, we believe that hand-crafting our beers sets us apart from the majority of breweries in the U.S. today. Our dedication is unparalleled and quite evident in the final packaged product.","","1995","N","","","","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","544B W.

"nMaqhu","Main Office","Barrel Trolley Beer harkens back to the days of secret handshakes and a flourishing underground world. During the days of prohibition when revelers crowded into hidden saloons, getting a beer was a clandestine process — the result of sharing a discreet password or speaking softly to avoid detection. Bootleggers flourished as they stealthily transported the prized cargo to thirsty revelers!     Using a seamless network of tracks, the covert trolley system of the 1920s was a bootleggers dream. This transport system was the ticket to an American revolution and the revolt against Prohibition. As the trolley’s connected underground speakeasies, mobsters teamed with bootleggers to distribute barrels of their precious brew. In a tribute to those brave soldiers of salvation, we bring you Barrel Trolley Pale Ale, Amber Ale, IPA, Nut Brown Ale and Belgian White Ale.","http://www.barreltrolley.com/","","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/EZcbxo/upload_VBtxUH-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/EZcbxo/upload_VBtxUH-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/EZcbxo/upload_VBtxUH-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","500 Redwood Blvd","Novato","California","94947","(415) 382-6900","38.074044","-122.5428851","Y","N","N","N","office","Office","US","United States","USA","","","","","",""
"UukHF7","Brewery and Beer Gardens!","Barrelhouse Brewing Co. is nestled in the rolling hills of San Luis Obispo County on the edge of Paso Robles and in the heart of wine country…what will our neighbors think?    As you turn off Ramada Drive and onto Marquita Way, you will meander around a majestic oak tree.  This majestic white oak stands in the middle of where the road would have gone, if not for this tree’s historical significance.  If you look closely at the trunk of this old oak, you will notice the mark of an equal armed cross carved into its bark. The cross was carved sometime between 1775 and 1776 when Spanish Lt. Colonel Juan Batista de Anza led more than 240 men, women and children on an overland journey from the frontier New Spain to settle in Alta California. During that 1,200 mile journey, the very thirsty Colonel carved the cross to signify the perfect location for a brewery…well, that’s our story at Barrelhouse and we can’t exactly prove it, but we’re sticking to it!  Historians believe that Juan Batista de Anza or someone on his team carved the cross to indicate a safe place to camp.  We think it makes a sweet logo, too!    After you pass the old oak, make a left on Limestone Way and look for the dragon fly…you can’t miss it.     Stop by, grab a brew or two and relax.  Enjoy our glorious beer gardens with friends while you listen to the waterfall and experience the central coast the way it was meant to be enjoyed…outside.  You can also pull up to the bar inside the brewery where you’ll feel like you’re part of the brewing action. Along with our amazing line-up of beers, we will also feature our very own custom crafted rootbeers.  If you ask nicely, we can even float a scoop of ice cream in your favorite sarsaparilla or stout.","http://www.barrelhousebrewing.com","2011","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rT7yN7/upload_BGEfmi-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rT7yN7/upload_BGEfmi-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/rT7yN7/upload_BGEfmi-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","3055 Limestone Way","Paso Robles","California","93446","(805) 296-1128","35.575975","-120.690655","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","","","2012","Monday-Tuesday: Closed  Wednesday-Thursday: 2-8  Friday-Saturday: 11-9  Sunday: 11-8","http://barrelhousebrewing.us5.list-manage1.com/subscribe/?u=ea30d6d47dfb4ee86877ced94&id=24c2c6c1e3",""

"bcXmR6","Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company","Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company is Williamsport's first production brewery since the 1950's. The brewery, which occupies 9,000 square feet at 429 W. 3rd St in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, was founded by Mike Hiller in July 2007.  Though a native of South Williamsport, Barbarian Chief, Mike Hiller, first entered the craft brewing industry in 1997 as an Account Services Associate for Legendary Distributors, Ltd., of Richmond, Virginia. After nearly a year of distributing beer, an opportunity arose for Mike to work as a brewer for Legend Brewing Company. Mike worked with five other brewers to perform duties at all levels of production including brewing, cellar work, cleaning and maintenance.  After nearly four years of service at Legend Brewing Company, Mike moved to Boston, MA, so his wife, Kira, could attend grad school. Tired of listening to him whine about how much he missed brewing, Kira gave him a home brewing kit as an anniversary gift. Mike began brewing whenever he could find the time. He developed the recipes for Hammerin' Ale, Headbangerz Brown Ale, Square Feet Wheat, Weldspatter I.P.A. and several other beers in five-gallon batches on his apartment's balcony.  Mike was also commissioned by friends and co-workers to brew beer for special occasions.  In fact, Square Feet Wheat was actually first brewed for an art gallery opening featuring works by the Barbarian's logo and label designer, Erick Thomas.  After reading Brewing Up a Business: Adventures in Entrepreneurship by Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head Brewery fame, Mike was inspired to start his own brewery. He spent eight months researching and writing a business plan. Another year was spent gathering support and revising his business plans. Thanks to the support of family, friends and other area businessmen who believed in Mike's dream, Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company is now a reality.","http://www.bavarianbarbarian.com","","N","","","","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","429 W. 3rd St","Williamsport","Pennsylvania","17701","570.332.5050","41.238187","-77.009056","Y","N","Y","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","","","","","",""

"P7Ug6t","Beach Chalet Brewery and Restaurant","The Beach Chalet Brewery & Restaurant is located above the Golden Gate Park Visitor's Center which features the amazing and historic WPA frescoes created by Lucien Labaudt in the 1930's. The artwork captures the flavor of San Francisco in that era in a style of the Arts and Crafts movement – a must see for fans of the style and for anyone who wants a taste of the strange and incredible period in which the WPA allowed art projects like this to exist during such hard times.    Upstairs you will find the Beach Chalet Brewery & Restaurant. It was developed by Gar and Lara Truppelli and Timon Malloy in 1997 after the Chalet had sat vacant for 17 years. To remodel and restore this historic building to its former glory so it could be a landmark to be enjoyed by future generations as well as to create a space for their restaurateurs’ dreams, they brought Heller Manus Architects onboard to help make their dreams a reality.    Today thousands of guests enjoy the Modern American Cuisine menu and hand crafted ales. The Beach Chalet offers a full bar, abundant free parking and a breathtaking ocean view. Bay Area residents and visitors find the Beach Chalet to be a wonderful San Francisco experience while visiting Golden Gate Park and Ocean Beach.

"EfLTd6","Bear Creek Brews","Bear Creek Brews has been a dream for over 30 years. Ever since the beginnings of the American Beer Renaissance, I have wanted to brew my own great tasting beer and make it available to the beer drinking public and help people learn about and appreciate beer. Coming from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, beer brewing is in my veins.    Twelve years ago my wonderful wife bought me the ""everything but the kitchen sink"" homebrew kit and it all started. After a few extract brew sessions, I built a 15 gallon brew sculpture and graduated to all-grain brewing, and things really got serious. Now after over 200 brews, BCB is in business!    The brewery is small, we call it a Nano-Brewery, we are hidden in the middle of 38 acres of woods in the heart of North Carolina. Most everything is recycled or made in-house. The Brew-House is an old 20' steel cargo container, the Beer-Garden brew patio is recycled flagstone and granite, nestled under spreading oaks and pines, our cooling water is stored rain water from a cistern, the chickens just love the spent mash. All the ingredients are as fresh as possible, some are even home grown. American malts, hops, and yeast are the mainstay of our beers. The water is from our 450' well and is just as pure and clean as can be. Our small batch brewing lets us assure you that each keg or bottle of beer will be as fresh and wonderful as though we were brewing it for ourselves to drink.","http://www.bearcreekbrews.com/","","N","","","","deleted","Deleted","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","10538 NC 902 Hwy","Bear Creek","North Carolina","27207","(919) 200-3930","35.6518126","-79.3329623","N","N","N","Y","nano","Nano Brewery","US","United States","USA","","","","","",""

Then there is Bee Creek's signature ales; a product of Brewmaster Mark Snelling's accomplished recipes of hops, honey, wheat, yeast and magical elements.  A navy veteran, he commands over 25 years brewing experience.","http://www.beecreekbrewery.com/","2007","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/phOfWZ/upload_PMLtSS-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/phOfWZ/upload_PMLtSS-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/phOfWZ/upload_PMLtSS-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","","Brazil","Indiana","","812-240-1147","39.515569","-87.132467","Y","N","Y","N","micro","Micro Brewery","US","United States","USA","","PO Box 515","2007","","",""

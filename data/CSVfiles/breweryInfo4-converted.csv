French Canadian trappers traveling west along the famous Red River Trail discovered this natural spring, which had the most refreshing water. Word of this spring spread and became a regular stop for all settlers going west on the Red River Trail. In 1857 Swiss born naturalist Armond DuPont wrote, “it is a water like no other, unique in its ability to refresh.” He noted, “Though seemingly impossible, a year-round frost forms at the base of this amazing spring.”    The brewery was built at the site of the spring and its water became the basis of all the award winning brews for over 125 years. In addition, the brewery has become the #1 energy drink and specialty drink producer in the country.

"PDva3w","Columbia Kettle Works","We are Rod Smith and Bill Collister. We have been working together for 13 years at Farason Corporation. www.farason.com We became friends quickly due partly for our love of engineering and automation, as well as, our love and passion for craft beers. Our favorite past time has been traveling around visiting craft breweries, brewpubs and taprooms together, along with our wives, for 10 years now. Rod took up home brewing 5 years ago and has become quite proficient at brewing delicious beers to the delight and enjoyment of his colleagues, friends, and family. Rod's talent for brewing and Bill's business experience seemed like a good match for a brewpub that would allow us to continue enjoying Rod's hobby to its fullest extent and share it with many more fellow craft brew enthusiasts. We expect the creation, operation, and continuing evolution of the brewpub to provide us another outlet for our passions by providing a quality product and environment in which to enjoy it, along with meeting and enjoying the company of many people with the same love and passion for high quality craft beer.    Originally we looked all over for a good location starting within a few miles of our homes and extending out as far as Columbia hoping for a place within reasonable driving distance from our homes. We believed the market would, to some extent, come to us. Over several months we looked at numerous potential sites and due to one reason or another couldn't find an acceptable location. We ran into floor restrictions, ceiling height issues, limited parking, zoning issues and unaffordable rent. When we eventually met and talked with David Doolittle, Doolittle Investments LLC, he showed us two potential sites in Columbia. David seemed very interested in bringing our type of business into Columbia and offered us reasonable lease pricing and an honest willingness to work with us to bring our dream of a microbrewery to reality. The drive is 35 minutes from our homes, but after considering the location as fairly equally distant between Lancaster and York (both of which have more than one brewery), and the fact we would be first in Columbia and nearby Marietta and Wrightsville, plus the proximity to Route 30, we were sold on the location. We have since discovered that Columbia Borough is quite willing to help us establish our business in their wonderful town. We are thankful and grateful for their assistance and cooperation and look forward to being a part of the community.    Our brewing equipment consists of a 5bbl brew kettle, a 5bbl mash tun, and a 5bbl hlt. We will have three 5bbl or larger fermenters. We are ale people so we will have blondes, pale ales, IPAs, Porters/Stoudts, bitters, and a variety of Belgian versions as well. We will open with 4 taps and gradually expand to 8.  We expect to open this winter, Nov/Dec., but that is dependent on receipt of the brewing equipment and completion of the site as tentatively scheduled. We will open quitely and plan for a more elaborate grand opening at a later date. This venture is a new experience for us and the people assisting us so we need to start out slowly.

Headquartered in Brampton, Ontario, the once-tiny Brewery grew steadily as its Cool Beer brand became increasingly successful. So much so, Cool had to expand its operations a number of times.    But the commitment to quality never changed.    By 2003, Cool was sufficiently well-established for the Brewery to launch another high-quality beer, new Millennium Buzz Beer. Buzz is a refreshing red lager which has also proved to be a resounding success.    Both Cool and Buzz will always be made with the finest ingredients, contain no additives whatsoever, and be put through the Brewery’s advanced cold-filtration system that makes them two of the most refreshing and thirst-quenching beers available.

"bfPDGk","COOP Ale Works","COOP Ale Works began with a humble home brewer and a simple dream. The idea spread as friends tasted the unique beers, and the popularity of those early batches encouraged a dedicated team of three partners to begin working to make the dream of a local brewery a reality. Mark Seibold, JD Merryweather and Daniel Mercer spent the next two years traveling throughout the United States, Europe and Central America visiting breweries and sampling local flavors. The insight gained from entrepreneurs, brewers, biologists, operations personnel and consumers provided an invaluable basis for a serious endeavor into quality commercial brewing. By integrating this knowledge with the local, regional and national brewing trends, as well as local feedback, the trio planned the birth and growth of the yet unnamed COOP. After nearly 3 years of research, comprising thousands of man hours and dozens of test batches, COOP fashioned its identity as a steadfast professional team that holds closely a passion for bringing quality, local beer to taps and homes in Oklahoma City and beyond.         With the help of close friends and fellow craft-beer fans, COOP was capitalized on July 15th, 2008. In less than 6 months, the COOP team; navigated the multi-layered regulatory process, secured a building lease, completed the remodel, purchased and installed a commercial brewery, obtained brewing licenses from the State of Oklahoma and the Federal Tax and Trade Bureau, created and branded original recipe beers and brewed the first full scale batches for distribution.    The outpouring of support that has come from friends of the COOP team has been overwhelming. Our sincere hope is that you – the fan of COOP Ale Works – will take pride in the beers, as if they were your own.

"hG1G1v","Cooperstown Brewing Company","The Cooperstown area had a significant impact on American Brewing. It started with the introduction of hop farming which flourished here until the end of the 19th century. Back then, Otsego and the surrounding counties produced most of the hops grown in the United States.    Traveling through the upper Susquehanna Valley towards Cooperstown in July 1898, a visitor would have enjoyed the view of hop farms with those beautiful hop vines reaching toward the midsummer sky. Grandfather Eckler ws a hop farmer and he used to say, ""The hop was King in those days!"" His hop farm was in Westville, NY only three miles up the Cherry Valley from where our Brewery is now located. When it came time for the hops to be harvested, Grandma Eckler would ""put up"" a dozen people from ""the City' and they would pick the hops for their room and board and a ""vacation"" in the country. My mother, Cynthia Eckler Hall, said she always loved it when the hop pickers came to the farm. Everyone had a lot of fun during the harvest. When the blight devastated his crop in the early 1900's, grandfather turned to dairy farming.  Settled by Englishmen in the early 1800's, Cooperstown once had two English-style breweries in town. Following that tradition, the Cooperstown Brewing Company was founded in 1994. We brew premium ales, porters, and stouts using the finest two-row English barley malts, West Coast hops and the English Ringwood Yeast.    Grandpa would be pleased if he could see the Brewery. We have hops growing here that survived the devastating blight to New York hop farming and those hops grown here are used to finish our Back Yard India Pale Ale.","http://www.cooperstownbrewing.com/","1994","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ybdwZK/upload_liqoWx-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ybdwZK/upload_liqoWx-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ybdwZK/upload_liqoWx-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","110 River Street","Milford","New York","13807","","42.605397","-74.981902","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","1994","United States","USA","607-286-9330","P.O.

"JZk4BM","Golden Brewery","In 1873, as the United States approached its centennial year, its people were busy building a new kind of nation. It was thirsty work. And that's where Coors Brewing Company came in. When we began in that same year, we were a small, family-owned brewery, located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. We were busy creating the same kind of crisp, refreshing beer we're known for today. While hundreds of such family-owned breweries have come and gone in the years since, we believe the reasons for our success are simple. We've never compromised on quality in producing our award-winning brews and we've never lost sight of our rich Rocky Mountain heritage. Just as important, we've always believed in doing well by doing good. We treat our employees with respect, we support the local communities where we do business, and we strive to protect the environment. That's just how we do business.","http://www.coors.com/","1895","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/avMkil/upload_zHTNq2-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/avMkil/upload_zHTNq2-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/avMkil/upload_zHTNq2-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","311 Tenth Street","Golden","Colorado","80401","","39.759876","-105.219026","Y","N","N","Y","macro","Macro Brewery","US","1873","United States","USA","1-866-812-2337","","","",""

"oz1oll","Costal Extreme Brewing Company","The Coastal Extreme Brewing Company was started in 1999 by four graduates of Colby College. During his college days the head brewer, Derek Luke, reaquired a homebrewing kit he had given his sister and quickly went to work brewing and passing his knowledge along to the company's president, Brent Ryan. As Graduation grew near and the cold reality of post-collegiate life set in Luke and Ryan knew that they could turn their affinity for beer and their new found ability to make it into a viable alternative to unemployment or sitting at a desk answering to ""The Man"". Of course, they couldn't do it by themselves, so after very little convincing, they got roommate and friends, Mark Sinclair and Will Rafferty to join them.    On Father's Day in 1999, after almost two years of planning and preperation, the first batch of Hurricane Amber Ale was brewed. By July 2nd the first kegs had been shipped to three Newport Restaurants and were quickly tapped and emptied. A little over a month after the release of the first kegs, 6-packs of Hurricane Amber Ale began to hit the shelves. Since then we have expanded our product line and our distribution territory but continue to brew up a storm in our Middletown Brewery.","http://www.newportstorm.com/","1999","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IphbdN/upload_4dE1nk-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IphbdN/upload_4dE1nk-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/IphbdN/upload_4dE1nk-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-09-26 13:18:19","307 Oliphant Lane","Middletown","Rhode Island","02842","","41.5369904","-71.2796012","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","1999","United States","USA","401-849-5232","","","",""

"WtMfgN","Crabby Larry's Brewpub Steak & Crab House","In 1990 Larry came up with the idea to sell produce from the corner of Rt. 463 and Lower State Road. He took Dani and the three kids to meet the owner of the property, Al Walters. Mr. Walters took an immediate liking to the Jones family and allowed Dani and Larry to sell produce from his corner. Being a farmer, he even started growing corn and other vegetables for them. One day, Larry's father showed up with a bushel of live crabs and left them with Dani to sell. The crabs sold so fast that they picked up more crabs, shrimp, and other types of seafood too. In 1994, Mr. Walters passed away and Dani and Larry had to move on to bigger and better things. They rented a space in the Chalfont Village Shopping Center and opened a restaurant and fresh fish market. Dani and Larry did all the cooking. Larry would go to the fish market daily to ensure the freshest seafood. And with the help of loyal family and friends, Jones Family Seafood became a popular seafood restaurant in the area.      Early in 2001, Larry received a mailing, the kind we all ignore, advertising ""Brew your own beer"". He was immediately hooked. After convincing Dani that this was a good idea, they met up with a ""brew master"", ordered the equipment, and they were on their way.","http://www.crabbylarrys.com/","1990","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/m6aqF7/upload_OQ2A32-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/m6aqF7/upload_OQ2A32-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/m6aqF7/upload_OQ2A32-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","237 West Butler Avenue","Chalfont","Pennsylvania","18914","","40.2795164","-75.2142895","Y","N","N","Y","brewpub","Brewpub","US","1990","United States","USA","215-822-8788","","","",""

"AFUMQ8","Croocked Moon","The name Croocked Moon is inspired by a graffiti drawing, I once saw a grinning moon. Its expression captured in many ways the philosophy I want to resist. This is also underlined by the name of the election. I want to create a brand with an attitude that is not afraid to push the limits and the current perception of what the actual individual beers represent. English ologists will notice the spelling error in the word ""Croocked"". This misspelling is because originally, that I was given webdomænet and because of a typo there had sneaked an extra ""c"" in. I wondered whether I should buy another domain name, but then decided that it actually fell very much in line with my philosophy about challenging the conventional way of perceiving the beers on: I want to signal a more aggressive and provocative attitude towards the conventional way put together on the beer.    The slogan ""Ergo Bibendum"", which loosely translated means ""why we drink"" is the old character and is used increasingly often by medical students when they are toast. The idea behind this slogan is simple. As a philosophy describes, I want to create beers that challenge and provoke, but simultaneously has a flavor that gives people reason to choose just one Croocked Moon when they want a beer, there is something beyond the usual.   Croocked Moon must in itself be an excellent reason to drink a beer (or two).","http://www.croocked-moon.com/","2009","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xi3c0z/upload_npeU2Y-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xi3c0z/upload_npeU2Y-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xi3c0z/upload_npeU2Y-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-10-08 16:04:24","Halmtorvet 29C","","Kobenhavn","1700","Tastings for a minimum of ten vary in price.","55.6678625","12.5564938","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","DK","","Denmark","DNK","","","208","",""

"yqQtUG","Brewery & Restaurant","If you could be doing whatever you want right now, what would you be doing? For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be ""listening to live music and drinking craft beer."" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.     There was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.     It was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.      Everyday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running ""off the grid"" as well.     Ken, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.

"CA3UzH","Dark Horse Brewing Company","Humble beginnings gave way to lessons learned of brewing in the shadows of the residence hall; steering clear of the landlord and having your ass handed to you by the almighty dollar are now consumed by the glory bells of success and the daily grind - a dichotomy of sorts… Should a young madman have to bend and be Ned Beatty’d to sell and serve to please the public eye’s nerve endings from the very beginning? Not this time around.     A brewer slowly climbed from the lowest points of business life with a sore ass, as he ascended to a new level. Hark! The horse of the dark nature holds the scales where the wheat and barley feedeth, not taketh from the mouths of man. A non-filtered view of hard work, careful perseverance of expansion, sticking to what is believed to be the right way and the only way to stay true to high quality, and also, the vague understandings of possible humor; blurring his family’s, employees’ and customers’ drinking experience and vision between a no-bullshit approach to brewing big, outstanding beers and selling nonsensical imagery and haberdashery…Proven to the masses as a Darkhorse trademark for the man behind the reigns.     Can true patrons of quality, time and devotion deal with the inner workings of a mad-man’s psyche as he speaks of visions of smacking Umpa Lumpas with snow shovels, or allows the obscure drawings of lawn jarts and tinker toys to be hung on the walls of his establishment? They seem to…A madman’s passion for brewing comes out in strange ways indeed; where his employees and fellow brew house boys may know not how to deal with his tongue twisted ramblings and contortions of the face at first; where the same can definitely scare away newcomers.     True patrons know how to accept the obscure humor. Some have lent a hand in some way or another. They know what “pour to the line” means; they have been to every annual crawfish boil and some find the passion within themselves to put the Darkhorse name to skin…still they barely understand the immature drawings created in the brewery… True patrons know the hard work the brewers put in to create and keep the Darkhorse name in the lead.     Some things in life are easily read and some things keep you guessing. Should we take turns consuming garage sale items and vomiting them on the walls or should we follow the square, straight and narrow? Slip into the pub and look around. Go out and buy a six-pack, and read the holder the beer comes in. Read the back of your growler. When you’re done, you’ll either get it or you won’t. No matter, as you’re drinking some of the best fuckin’ beer made in the great state of Michigan.

"qcAp7N","De Struise","De Struise Brouwers (DSB) is a small beer company currently located in Oostvleteren, Belgium. In its brief commercial life to date, it has garnered respect and admiration from the beer enthusiast community and won several awards.    Owners of a nearby ostrich-raising farm in Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern.    Upon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational.    The company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning ""tough"". They render the name into English as ""The Sturdy Brewers"", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij 't IJ.    Following current industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, DSB has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. While often drawing upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique products which reflect their own personal vision.    They have also collaborated with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers.","http://www.struisebrouwers.be/","2001","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_rK0nnu-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_rK0nnu-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/bjwFtZ/upload_rK0nnu-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Woesten","Woesten","West-Vlaanderen","","","50.900311","2.7831","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","BE","2001","Belgium","BEL","","","56","",""

"TkT8Rc","Dick's Brewing Company","Dick Young started brewing as a home brewer in 1984 and sold homebrew supplies at his business, Northwest Sausage & Deli.  When he wasn’t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick’s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick’s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick’s Brewing Company became a reality.    Dick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, “I started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty”.   And we are all so grateful he was.    The brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick’s Beers were flying out the door.  In 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.    Dick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.

"64Bwb3","Dickersbach Brewing Company","A long long time ago, in a far away place called North Carolina it all started. My great friend, and then neighbor, Randy and I decided it was time to start brewing beer since we could not longer get our then favorite brew in the stores. Our first beer was aptly named ""Girly Beer"" and was light and refreshing.    From there the brews continued until we were out of storage space. Our paths separated, but we each continued brewing. My brother Mike, soon took to brewing also and has been an avid brewer for many years now.    Background experience comes from homebrewing, being head brewer at Hal and Mal's in Jackson, MS, and head brewer at Riverhorse, in Lambertville, NJ.","http://www.dickersbachbrewing.com/","1992","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/YG37Js/upload_VdnsHf-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/YG37Js/upload_VdnsHf-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/YG37Js/upload_VdnsHf-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","","Yardley","Pennsylvania","","","40.245664","-74.8459972","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","1992","United States","USA","","","","",""

"UfTXZT","Dirty Hands Brewing Company","The road to the creation of Dirty Hands Brewing began during those halcyon days of college where Grant (UCLA) and Phil (University of Utah/University of Wyoming) started developing an appreciation for great beer. They first met during graduate school at the University of Minnesota where the fates would have it, they joined the same chemistry research group.  The guys spent many a night proving the adage of their PhD (piled higher & deeper) advisor, “The true test of running a scientific instrument is being able to operate it after a few beers.”  After graduation, Grant and Phil pursued different career paths, Grant went the academic route, while Phil initially started out in the chemical industry, but then wised up and conned people into hiring him as a beer then wine chemist.  After a few years of chasing the academic and corporate dollar, the boys wised up and decided to strike out on their own.  They landed in Vancouver, WA (which was the first Vancouver, by the way) and started up Dirty Hands Brewing Company.  From the start, their goal was to brew full flavored beers that were both balanced and highly drinkable.  So, they set to work, getting their hands dirty renovating the space that was the old Columbian Newspaper building to a working brewery and taproom.  Speaking of the newspaper, that’s how the name came about.  Think of reading a hard copy paper and how your hands would look from getting newsprint all over them!  The brewery also strives to honor the working past of Vancouver and Washington state by using locally sourced ingredients in the beer and food that we serve.","http://dirtyhandsbrewing.com","","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ywrnRJ/upload_kHJSLD-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ywrnRJ/upload_kHJSLD-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ywrnRJ/upload_kHJSLD-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-09-23 15:46:51","114 E.

"bTThBS","Doodle Brewing Company","The Doodle Brewing Company was started by Nick Vaughn in 2008. Nick graduated from the University of Missouri-Columbia with a degree in Chemical Engineering. After graduation, Nick got a call from the Harpoon Brewery in Boston and they were willing to give him a shot. While he was working out east, he enjoyed the superb beer culture and variety of beers available in New England. But he knew that he would one day return to Missouri. Finally, after three years, probably too many beers, and the addition of his son, Nick finally got his chance to come back to Missouri. He worked at a small brewpub in Kansas City called The 75th Street Brewery where he was able to experiment with many different beer styles and brewing techniques. Again after a few years, Nick grew restless. While working at a brewpub was fun and enjoyable, it just had too many other distractions from his true passions... Brewing beer, drinking beer and spreading the word about craft beer.  So he started the Doodle Brewing Company with every intention of brewing beers and beer styles that explore the boundries of flavor. He's probably sitting in front of his brewhouse right now with a beer enjoying what he's doing because he's making beer for you.","http://www.doodlebrewing.com/","2008","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ifZ8V4/upload_S4bCUw-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ifZ8V4/upload_S4bCUw-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/ifZ8V4/upload_S4bCUw-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","600 Haines Drive","Liberty","Missouri","64068","","39.254543","-94.455085","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","2008","United States","USA","","","","",""

"DXRyuX","Draai Laag Brewing Company","Traditionally, all goods were made or sold locally.  Butchers, bakers, farmers and even brewers, made their products for local consumption.    Founded in 2009, Draai Laag began as a way to introduce beer with creative flavors into the market, offering a bit of variety in a world of Pilsners, Pales Ales and Porters.    Here at Draai Laag we use old world methods, such as bottle conditioning by aging our ales on lees.  We brew in small batches and use several strains of yeast to produce our beers.   The drinker may notice slight nuances from batch to batch.  But, you will find that all our ales are aged and, just like a fine wine, can be laid down for extended periods.   This results in a unique drinking experience each time a bottle is opened.    Here at Draai Laag we like to cater to those that want something respectful of tradition, but ultimately different.  Those who are not satisfied drinking the norm.  Most importantly, we get our biggest enjoyment and fulfillment not from profit, but from your smile after the first sip.

Expanding in 2009 and again in 2011, Dry Dock currently runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location on Hampden Ave. in Aurora.

Dry Dock’s production has grown from 300 barrels in 2006 to 3,200 in 2012. With the new facility, they will produce about 11,000 BBL in 2013.

The philosophy of the brewery is one of purity — we keep the beer in its purest form by bottle-conditioning it. It isn’t filtered, isn’t pasteurised and is naturally carbonated so there is minimum interference with it between raw ingredients and finished product. We always start with the best quality ingredients including; Maris Otter malt, full leaf hop cones and the limestone rich water of West Waterford.  Our brewer strives for quality and consistency across every stage of the brew, working hard to ensure that each bottle achieves the high standards he has set. All the beers are craft brewed in small batches and by its artisan nature this can lead to slight variations by batch.  The brewhouse is a 6bbl plant made by PBC Brewery Installations, the UK’s top micro brewery installer and is ideally suited to the bottle-conditioned traditional ales that we brew.  Bottling is currently done by hand with a four-head filler with plans to upgrade this to an automated system in the coming months.","http://www.dungarvanbrewingcompany.com/","2010","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vFrJjr/upload_bZH4oN-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vFrJjr/upload_bZH4oN-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/vFrJjr/upload_bZH4oN-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","Unit 5 No. 2","","Waterford","","","52.0955413","-7.633504","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","IE","","Ireland","IRL","+353 58 24000","Westgate Business Park","372","",""

"bGabak","E.C. Dahls Bryggeri","E.C. Dahls Brewery (E.C. Dahls Bryggeri) is a brewery and soft drink factory based in Trondheim, Norway.    E.C. Dahls Brewery was founded in 1856 by Erich Christian Dahl (1814–1882), a local businessman and consul-general from Trondheim. He was the son of Erich Dahl (1774-1821) Christine Lyche (1776-1861). His parents had been the owners of an import-export business and shipping company. In 1851, Erich Christian Dahl had bought the Sugarhouse (Sukkerhuset) in the Kalvskinnet area of Trondheim, where there had been a sugar refinery since 1754. Sukkerhuset was rebuilt for brewing. The brewery stayed in the building until 1984.    The first bottle of Bayerøl, a Munich-style dunkel, was sold in 1857. In 1910, the plant began to produce soft drinks at the brewery as well. Bayerøl was the most important type of beer until the early 20th century when Dahls Pils, a pilsener took over as the most popular beer.    In 1966, it was merged with Trondheim Akti Brewery (Trondhjems Aktiebryggeri), which was founded in 1899 and Trondheim Brewery (Trondhjems Bryggeri) which dated to 1919. E.C.

"wW6rQJ","Eastern Shore Brewing Co","Eastern Shore Brewing opened it's doors September of 2008 by owners Adrian and Lori Moritz.  Both had an entrepanerial passion, but never thought of a microbrewery as their business.  ""The decision was made for us.  Make a business out of something you love to do and you will never work another day in your life"" the couple states.  A lot of hard work and a love for good beer motivates the business.   We decided to open Eastern Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael's Winery, and were told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers took home medals in the Maryland Govenor's cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael's Amber ALe) on October 9th.  And although happy with the medals, Eastern Shore Brewing's goals are to continue to grow the busines and improve their products.

The brewery is a small 17-barrel (527 gallon) batch system and operates on the Acevedo's rural residential property.  Within seven months of opening El Toro Brewing Company received its first national recognition at the 1994 Great American Beer Festival (GABF). One of its flagships El Toro Oro Golden Ale won a coveted Gold Medal for English Pale Ale. At the 1996 GABF Poppy Jasper Amber Ale, the brewery's other flagship beer, won a Silver Medal for English Brown Ale. It is a mild yet robust brown ale. The 1997 GABF saw El Toro garner another Gold Medal for the American styled wheat beer named after the brewer's father-in-law, William Jones Wheat Beer.  After 16 years of planning, Geno and Cindy Acevedo of Morgan Hill finally opened a brewpub on November 25 2006. El Toro Brewpub is a two floored building with patio. Inside is the world's only Poppy Jasper Bar. Featuring over 45 feet of gorgeously inlaid and polished Poppy Jasper rock into its surface. To the back of the large mirrored bar you will find over 25 beers and handcrafted sodas on tap. We also have a gleaming copper Pub Brewing system 3 BBL (100 gallon) brewery.

Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling.

"E6WUse","Engine 15 Brewing Company","Engine 15 Brewing Co. was born of the need for great beer!  Way back in 1988, Luch Scremin was a Freshman in college and became interested in brewing his own beer.  Since the internet did not exist, Luch was forced to order a “beer kit” from an ad in the back of an issue of Popular Mechanics.  Suffice it to say that what resulted was indeed beer but was far from great.    Fast forward twenty years and the love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew.  Luch traveled the world with his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles and beer culture.  In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub,  Luch met his future business partners Andy and Sean.  The three were soon making the business a reality.    All that was left was a name.  They soon decided they would name the brewery for Luch’s 1962 Ford Fire Engine – after all, they just don’t make them like that anymore.  It represents all that Engine 15 Brewing Co. is about. Camaraderie, old school know how, determination and a simple but serious dedication to the cause.  As of 2011, Engine 15 Brewing Co. has enjoyed success and was even voted best Pub and Brewpub  in Jacksonville by the Folio Weekly readers poll.  At Engine 15 Brewing Co. you’ll find a friendly atmosphere where you can enjoy a dizzying array of beers, both brewed in house and imported from the far reaches of the globe, eat a tasty meal and even brew your own beer!

Training and competing in track and road running events brought them together. They soon found another shared interest--experiencing the world of beer. The two made many friends spending spare evenings in New England pubs offering European beers, which, before the emergence of American craft beers, were the best beers available. The two often discussed their dream of opening their own brewery over the years. In August of 2012, John and Dan decided to take the keg into their own hands, and ENKI Brewing Company was born. Just a few months later, their dreams came to fruition at 7929 Victoria Drive.

"YKa9wh","Equinox Brewing Company","The most common question we get is, why Equinox Brewing? The equinox, and the intrigue of equal night and day, has deep roots in history and ritual. But, at the same time, the equinox marks the changing of the season, and forces us to look toward the future. We find it interesting that the two days out of the year that have perfect light and dark balance also show the balance between the past and the future, tradition and innovation. Beer contains similar elements. Sure, there’s the balance of flavors in a beer; sweet and bitter, rich and simple…    We find another aspect of beer’s balancing act fascinating. Historically, beer styles have developed because of limitations in local ingredients and the necessity to make do with what you have. However, due to global trade and modern shipping methods, limitations on ingredients have been removed. We can get any ingredients we want. While most modern brewers recognize the importance of beer styles and learn from the brewers who made them, they certainly don’t limit themselves to making beers that fit into traditional definitions.    On one level our beers fit into some traditional styles, but we put our own twist on them. We want our beers to capture elements from the past and incorporate new ideas, ingredients and techniques into them. We’re not afraid to try new things.    As a brewer, its playtime and work, balanced.","http://www.equinoxbrewing.com/","2010","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wYyIFx/upload_b1atTK-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wYyIFx/upload_b1atTK-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/wYyIFx/upload_b1atTK-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","133 Remington Street","Fort Collins","Colorado","80524","","40.586331","-105.0757067","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","2010","United States","USA","970-430-6489","","","",""

"MWi5Kp","Esser's Cross Plains Brewery","Arriving in Madison, Wisconsin on May 11, 1852 from a village in Germany called Ichendorf, George Esser possessed little more than the clothing on his back, a talent for masonry, and a taste for good, traditional German beer. Esser started producing lager in a small brewery he bought in Monroe for $1,500. In 1863, he purchased 2 1/2 acres of land in Cross Plains. The original building had two cellars below and several rooms above to house Esser's family. The beer, known as Esser's Best, was first brewed in October, 1863. He was joined in this enterprise in 1881 by his son Jacob. At that time, the brewery had a capacity of 2,000 barrels. A barrel of beer cost $7, and a case containing 36 pint bottles was priced at $1.75. Jacob and his sons, primarily Werner (W.B.) and Peter (Spundt) began delivering beer to the surrounding communities, often starting out as early as 3 a.m. Werner acted as Brew master from 1907 to 1910. It was increased competition from the larger breweries that forced him to become a distributor. The first beer that he handled as a distributor was Hausmann's originally brewed in Madison in 1920, Werner became the distributor for Blatz Near Beer. Following Prohibition in 1933, the company again to distribute beer. It should be noted that during prohibition, Werner and his brothers were kept very busy taking care of the beer needs in the area, mostly doing business at night. In 1937, Werner's eldest son, Roman, became a partner. At this point, the company began to handle Old Style products out of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The family tradition continued when Del Esser, Werner's youngest son, joined the firm in 1948. In 1988, Roman's son, Wayne, took over the business. In 1990, Wayne was joined in the business by his son, Larry, which made six generations of Essers in the bee business. It should also be noted that the Essers were distributors of Blatz and Old Style products until they sold the distributorship in January 1998 to Frank Beer in Middleton, Wisconsin. Frank beer is currently the distributor of Esser's Best in the area.","http://www.essersbest.com/","1852","N","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xHovlT/upload_RDu1B5-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xHovlT/upload_RDu1B5-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/xHovlT/upload_RDu1B5-large.png","verified","Verified","2012-01-03 02:41:33","2014-07-23 19:11:34","2109 Hickory Street","Cross Plains","Wisconsin","53528","","43.114731","-89.653129","Y","N","N","Y","micro","Micro Brewery","US","","United States","USA","1-608-798-3911","","","",""

We are also focused on bringing sessionable craft beer to everyone. The biggest trend, and subsequent impediment, in craft/micro brewing is the almost obsessive need to make the biggest, hoppiest, strangest beer possible, which is great for advancing the boundaries of what can be done with beer but does not satisfy a daily thirst. We pride ourselves on making great beer, with all the flavor one could want, that people will actually want to drink whenever and with whatever. Again, great doesn’t have to be complicated.    Another of our fundamental ideas is that brewing is free, and should be open. So, with this in mind, we will share as many of our “secrets” as possible with everyone so that they too can make great beer at home.

Against all odds, convinced that he could make high quality, natural beers Scharer set off about perfecting his recipes and methods. In 1981 he received the recognition he deserved in the form of the first (on Premises) brewing License ever awarded in Australia. He then set about setting up the first Pub Brewery.    In 1987, Scharer opened George IV Inn in Picton where we tapped his traditional style perfected brews. This huge step paved the way for many of the fantastic craft beers now brewed and enjoyed throughout Australia today.    In the early 1990’s Scharer operated and lived in the Australian Hotel in The Rocks where his famed ales (Lager and Bock) were the only beers on tap. If one was to ask for a different mainstream beer, they would be told upfront ‘we don’t sell that shit here’ and moved onto the next pub down the road. Geoff was a larrikin and larger than life itself.    In the early 2000’s Geoff sold the pub and brewery on one condition ‘the recipes never changed’ and to this day – they haven’t.    In May 2012, Geoff the man known as ‘one of the Grandfathers of Australian Craft beer’ passed away in his sleep. A huge loss of one of the legends of the industry; his legacy will forever live on in his beers.","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/s3OJNh/upload_C8GtgM-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/s3OJNh/upload_C8GtgM-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/s3OJNh/upload_C8GtgM-large.png","Picton","+61 2 4677 1415","","","","","",""

For more than 400 years the brewery has been taking care that the local traditional beers are supplied regionally as well as internationally.    It is no longer important how advanced we are and how much technical support we use during our daily processes. The most important aspect for us is that we keep our traditional heritage. As we know the saying ""New is not in comparison with the word better"".    The Schlossbrauerei Au-Halltertau respects the tradition and heritage of quality traditional premium brewing. For more than 400 years the brewery has been taking care that the local traditional beers are supplied regionally as well as internationally. The first documented brew master was the royal court brew master named ""Schweiger"" in 1590. At that time the Noble Freiherr Baron von Thurn was the lord of the castle. He was the fourth noble lord since 990 a.d through 1281 a.d that ruled in Au Hallertau.    Since 1846 the Noble rulers and Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz have ruled and resided in the magnificent ""Moated Castle"" in Au i.d. Hallertau.    The noble family of Baron Freiherren Beck von Peccoz is still living in the castle an in the meantime it is the 6th generation.    At present Baron Freiherr Beck von Peccoz is making sure that the Castle Brewery stays a traditional brewery together with the necessary vision into the future to create a sustainable traditional premium quality future.    Michael Baron Freiherr Beck von Peccoz’s utmost desire is not to miss a successful sustainable future and at the same time to keep up the 6 generations of writing a successful historical event for the Castle brewery and it history.    The Brew Master Mr. Stefan Ebensperger is supporting the Baron with his highly qualified experience and skills. The necessary emotions and bindings towards a brewing heritage that has been passed down for generations is needed. Tradition is naturally one of the highest priorities for Mr. Ebensperger due to our traditional purity laws dating back to 1516 a.d therefore you can be assured that the quality is a premium German and he says, ""It will also stay like that"". Since 1516 the Bavarians have known how important the quality of the ingredients and the brewing process actually are. Beer was known during the Middle Ages as the same significant value as bread. As a part of the staple die, it was also germ free and full of healthy calories. During that time the average citizen spent a good 20 percent of their income on beer.    On the 23. April 1516 the Bavaria Duke Wilhelm IV. Executed and introduced the famous Bavarian Purity law into the Bavarian Parliament in Ingolstadt with the famous words: ""Just like beer in Summer an in winter as well as the county or province it is brewed or served"" Since that day it is prohibited to brew beer for the German market with anything else apart from hops, malt, water and yeast. In 1918 the Weimarer Republik accepted the Bavarian purity law into its republic, therefore the Bavarian purity then became a German law. Under the purity law or Bavaria and Germany the Castle Brewery, inspects, insures and stores all its quality premium beers as in the past historical way the Castle Lords and Brew Masters did.","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HJTHzW/upload_YbYgau-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HJTHzW/upload_YbYgau-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HJTHzW/upload_YbYgau-large.png","Au in der Hallertau","+49 / 87 52 / 86 32","","1590","","","",""

Franconia is a stronghold of time-honored brewing practices. At our brewery, deep in Franconia, our beers are steeped in tradition. Innovation, however, is no stranger to us. We love beer, and we brew it with a passion.  A.D. 1996: During an era of falling beer consumption and aggressive concentration in the beer market, I decided to build a brewery. Though small, I wanted to build a brewery with the intent of brewing beers of the highest quality.    Worlds away from the usual offerings of run-of-the-mill breweries who make mass-produced beer, we brew specialty beers for those who still cherish handmade tradition. We have continued to expand the niche for our strong beers and have remained steadfast in the face of stiff competition.    All the might of Franconia is brewed into our Schorsch Bock and our Schorsch Franconian Wheat, both of which contain 13% alcohol. They are the strongest beers in Germany and at the pinnacle among the world’s strongest.    Our Schorsch Bock 16 has broken every record. It is the strongest lager beer in the world.","","","","Gunzenhausen-Oberasbach","(9831) 1868","","","","","",""

Several years ago, three dads and two uncles would gather on a Saturday in one of their garages to master the art of home brew. Before long, the salesman of the group said, “You know, this is good enough to sell.” So the friends set out to do just that.    The name “Seven Brides” actually came from the dads’ kids. Between three of them, they have seven daughters. With the rising cost of wedding nuptials, the guys decided they needed to sell enough beer to pay for their daughters weddings.

We call it the fidelis philosophy.    We’re true to nature because environmental impact is a consideration in every decision we make. We honor the nature of materials that we work with. No shortcuts, no artifice. We’re true to the craft because we honor traditions of workmanship perfected by centuries of well-trained hands.    The Fidelis Philosophy took root in the fertile soil of Shawnee-On-Delaware, Pennsylvania. Our village, bounded by wooded hills on one side and the Delaware River on the other, enjoys a mild and varied climate, plenty of water and sun, abundant plants and wildlife and friendly, talented people. We are captivated by this nature and its possibilities. And our location- less than 100 miles from both New York City and Philadelphia- makes it only natural for us to broadly share the Fidelis Philosophy.    In a world of mass-production, our products are handmade. In a world of homogeneity, our products represent a defiant individuality. In a world without roots, our products embody a tangible sense of place. We aspire to eat what we grow, to drink what we brew, and to build what we use.

With a lot of elbow grease, blind ambition and a little luck, the quest to create a community pub in Northwest Lower Michigan began to take shape.  The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.    Today Short’s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.

Signature Brew brings them both together. Music provides the drive for making beers that are challenging, engaging and refreshing.    First and foremost we want to make beers, inspired by music, that we are proud of and love drinking. That is the beginning and end, of why we run Signature Brew, but let’s fill you in on the inbetween...    Signature Brew began life as a three man (Dave, Tom & Sam) crusade against the monotonous nature of the beer at all the gigs we had played, and been to, over the years. When the music on stage was a labor of love and art, we didn’t want to enjoy it with passionless, uninspiring and insipid lagers.    In 2011 we began trying to change this. We spoke to a few bands we knew to see if they’d be interested in brewing with us (they were), and so we set about taking our home brewing to a commercial level.    The new ‘Signature Brew : Originals’ range launched in 2014, crossing musical and beer boundaries. Taking creative control for ourselves and using our experience from the last 3 years to make beers that everyone will enjoy and appreciate.","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hz694U/upload_Gklh7r-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hz694U/upload_Gklh7r-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/hz694U/upload_Gklh7r-large.png","","442076844664","","","","http://signaturebrew.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=bd9eb29df5db1ee7ef7fe5b3b&id=9ccdbc66df","",""

We operated with a menu of fresh, made-to-order hamburgers, fresh cut French Fries and real ice cream shakes. Our 2nd location was here at our Silverdale location. We had fun and we still have Silver City Guests ask us about 39 cent hamburgers and grilled onion burgers. We miss 'em too, but we proved it's real hard to put the big hamburger chains out of business. It isn't as easy as it looks.    In 1996 we decided to switch gears and get into the Brewpub business.

During its heyday, the Skagway Brewing Company and its brew master Herman Barthel, the most technologically adorned brewer on the West coast, produced up to 30,000 barrels of beer per year and had a bottling operation on site. Multiple breweries operated out of Skagway during the peak of the Gold Rush and by 1900 competition was fierce amongst them. With the Skagway economy on a decline due to the fervor of the gold rush ending and growing prohibition support, the Skagway Brewing Company closed its doors in 1904. In 1916, the “Alaska Bone Dry Law” was passed effectively ending the making and consumption of alcoholic beverages in the Territory of Alaska.    In 1997, a local entrepreneur reopened the Skagway Brewing Co. in the Golden North Hotel until 2002 when it again ceased operations. With the brewing tanks collecting dust and locals thirsty for microbrews, South Dakota native and long time Skagway resident, Michael Healy spotted an opportunity and bought the equipment in 2007. Operating in a brand new building, the Skagway Brewing Company again fired up the brew tanks and on July 4th, 2007 opened its doors once again much to the pleasure of locals and visitors alike.

Prior to its formation, Dave Fox launched and operated the Skull Coast Ale Company, a limited liability company (LLC.), located in Fort Mill, South Carolina, organized in 2009. Without the investment dollars needed to start his own brewery, the Skull Coast Ale Company operated as a “Contract Brewing” or “Beer Marketing” company, in craft beer terms. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, the company contracted with other breweries to produce its beer recipes, and marketed the products under the Skull Coast name.    After months of recipe development and searching for a brewery to contract with, Dave Fox brewed Skull Coast's first beer on St. Patrick's Day, 2010, in Virginia. The result was Maelstrom IPA; a true west coast style India Pale Ale, aggressively hopped with seven different Northwest hops. After months of traveling back and forth between South Carolina and Virginia to brew and transport kegs (roughly seven hours each way), Dave sought out a second contract brewing relationship closer to home. Unfortunately, every Carolina brewery Dave approached was at or near capacity. Undeterred, Dave created his own capacity. In the first of its kind contract model, Dave purchased his own 60bbl fermenter and bright tanks, and placed them in another brewery.    The Skull Coast Brewing Company is the continuation of a lifelong dream. The brand was born in a small Charleston library after looking at a local map drawn in the 1700's, during the Golden Age of Piracy, with the words ""Skull Coast"" etched along the Carolina coastline. The Skull Coast products matured and our understanding of the beer business was developed during our contract brewing experience, under the Skull Coast Ale Company. Now, with a new entity, our own facility and unrestricted in our growth, the Skull Coast Brewing Company hopes to become a lifelong part of your history.","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_8OZR9o-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_8OZR9o-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/HX4Prz/upload_8OZR9o-large.png","Fort Mill","803-619-9295","","","","","",""

Established by John Sleeman, with a lineage that extends over five generations, John takes particular pride in his heritage. In fact, when it comes to beer tradition, his grandfather George A. Sleeman wrote the book on it - literally.     John's family's brewing tradition in Canada extends back to 1834 when John H. Sleeman arrived in Ontario from Cornwall, England. By 1851, he started the first Sleeman brewery to be located in Guelph, Ontario, brewing small 100-barrel batches.     The passion that drove John's great-great-grandfather to begin his renowned Canadian brewing tradition is the same passion that runs through John's veins today - and we look forward to passing on the tradition to many more generations to come.    An art as much as a science, beer making depends equally on the talent of the brewmaster and the quality of the ingredients.     Premium brewing employs a time-honoured process in which natural ingredients are blended in myriad combinations and brewed in small batches to produce beers that range from contemporary light brews to 'Old World' dark stouts.","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/D61TcY/upload_B9Bsxc-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/D61TcY/upload_B9Bsxc-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/D61TcY/upload_B9Bsxc-large.png","Guelph","1-519-822-1834","","","","","",""

The famous brewpub, with a throw-back to the wild west, is adorned with big game mounts and bar-stools made with six-shooters and patinated saddles and features a full pub menu with selections that compliment Saratoga's finest craft beers.","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_4X9zOz-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_4X9zOz-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/u8Rbm0/upload_4X9zOz-large.png","Saratoga","307-760-2302","Hours: 3 PM â€“ 9 PM","","PO Box 869","","",""

Slumbrew is the research & development brand and concept of Somerville Brewing Company. Our mission is to brew unique, ingredient-driven beers that challenge common notions of what a beer should taste like. It is the result of nearly 15 years of beer travel and research by Caitlin Jewell and Jeff Leiter; and a decade of Jeff’s homebrewing recipe formulation.    We produce a lot of small-run, pilot beers at the Slumbrew Beerlab, but only a small number make their way to commercial production. The Somerville Brewing Company contracts with regional breweries to make the best recipes for wide-spread commercial release, but each recipe is an evolving process of refinement. This model for beer production provides an opportunity to experiment with innovative local ingredients to produce craft beers that stand apart from typical formulations.","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gwDTjS/upload_BJqSCO-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gwDTjS/upload_BJqSCO-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/gwDTjS/upload_BJqSCO-large.png","Somerville","1-800-428-1150","","2011","","","",""

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

After years of brewing and competing with each other for kudos in their local community, Mike Price and Jon Northup decided to join forces and produce the best beer that we—using our combined brewing experience—could produce.    Saint Boniface is the name of the patron saint of brewers, the saint also associated with converting Germany to Christianity. St. Boniface saw the unconverted Saxons worshiping Thor and knew something must be done. The humble saint took an axe to the massive Thor Oak, which was sacred to the Saxons, in order to show them that his God was mightier than theirs. With fierce and repeated blows he leveled the massive tree; those around him feared God and were converted to Christianity.    The deed of Boniface provides an elegant analogy for our own mission at Saint Boniface Craft Brewing Co. Mike and Jon have witnessed many beer “pagans” worshiping the false gods of the big beer industry and see that it is time to take a Boniface-like swing at converting some of those people to a better way of life, one full of rich, tasty, more satisfying brews.","","","","Ephrata","717-721-1744","Thurs: 6:00 pm - 9:00 pm  Sat:	9:00 am - 4:00 pm","","Suite 401","","",""

John was inspired by a tradition of brewing on this site, the foundations of which were laid four centuries earlier. Back in the 13th century the Franciscans established an Abbey, with its own well, on the banks of the River Nore in Kilkenny. Whilst brewing and barley cultivation are recorded in Irish Annals from the mists of time, the strong brewing tradition that exists in Kilkenny started with these monks who would have brewed their own light ale for their visitors, using water from St Francis' Well. To this day the Abbey stands proudly at the heart of the brewery and continues to inspire our brewers.","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/basAdv/upload_DNmXuc-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/basAdv/upload_DNmXuc-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/basAdv/upload_DNmXuc-large.png","Kilkenny Co.","+353 (0)56 779 64 98","","1710","","","",""

After several years of apprenticing with other master brewers, Mark was ready to begin crafting beer using his own recipes.    He found the perfect spot in Charlottesville, VA; a historic storefront on Main Street that was once home to the state of Virginia’s first craft brewing operation. In September 1999, Mark re-opened the doors and introduced the Starr Hill Brewery. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its historic building with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall, and it was there that Mark's delicious craft beers became a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world. Nineteen prestigious awards later, Mark’s brews continue to be a hit at beer and music festivals nationwide.    In 2005, in response to the growing demand, Mark moved from this small brewing operation to a larger brewing facility several miles outside of town, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's core and seasonal brews are now enjoyed in restaurants and music clubs throughout the Mid Atlantic and Southeast, and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores in the region.    Mark is proud of the awards his microbrews have earned, and the experts agree that he is among the best craft brewers in the country. But at the end of the day, what still matters most to Mark and his team of brewers at Starr Hill is giving people the gift of great beer.","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4TuN55/upload_zLn8EZ-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4TuN55/upload_zLn8EZ-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/4TuN55/upload_zLn8EZ-large.png","Crozet","434-823-5671","","1999","","","",""

We have had a fantastic time making mead and meeting mead drinkers from all over the world, and now its our turn to share our love of mead with all of you!    Becky Starr, Owner, Sales/Tasting Room Manager  Ben Starr, Owner, Wine/Meadmaker    We first discovered mead in CA at the Southern California Renaissance Pleasure Faire. Several years later, we found friends that were home brewing mead with good results. We decided to try our hand at it too.    In February 2006, we entered our first competition and took Best in Show out of over 210 entries in the home mead-maker category at the International Mead Association’s Mead Festival. The competition was judged by seven professionals in the mead industry; including Ken Schramm, author of The Compleat Mead Maker, and meadery owners from around the world. The Best in Show prize was selected from the gold medal winners in nine categories. Our “Starrlight Mulled Apple Cyser” was awarded not only the gold medal in the cyser (mead made with apples) category, but was also selected as the best overall representation of mead making. It was at that point we decided to try creating a business from our love of mead.    Ben shares his expertise and love of brewing by conducting demonstrations and workshops on mead making in the local community. We also organize and conduct the local Mead Day celebration each August (since 2005) and are a key part of the product tasting team for mead reviews on Gotmead.com. Becky worked with Chatham Hill Winery for 2 years learning tasting room and wine club management. We are members of the Chatham County Beekeepers Association, and the NC Winegrowers Association.","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hdz6Zk/upload_lvyIUz-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hdz6Zk/upload_lvyIUz-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/Hdz6Zk/upload_lvyIUz-large.png","Pittsboro","919-533-6314","Regular Hours  Thursdays and Fridays from noon til 6 pm    Saturdays from noon til 6 pm  Meadery tours at 1 pm, 3 pm & 5 pm.

This little town in Northern New South Wales has influenced everything we do at Stone & Wood.    Not only has it helped shape our philosophy of trying to take things slowly and keeping it simple, but the natural beauty, on the edge of the Pacific Ocean, and the laid back vibe were the inspiration for our beers.    ‘Byron’ is a destination for visitors from around the world and we’re always grateful we get to call the place home.","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/buuCTR/upload_uOWWKX-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/buuCTR/upload_uOWWKX-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/buuCTR/upload_uOWWKX-large.png","Byron Bay","+61 2 6685 5173","","2008","","","",""

In 1848, during the German Revolution, Bernhard Stroh, having apprenticed at his father side, immigrated to the United States. He established his own brewery in Detroit in 1850. Stroh named his new company Lion's Head Brewery, adopting the Lion's Crest logo from the Kyrburg Castle in Germany – the same crest that adorns Stroh beers today    After establishing the brewery, Bernhard's son, Bernhard Jr., continued its expansion. A firm proponent of tradition and quality, he introduced the European method of fire-brewing to America. The fire-brewing process uses a direct flame rather than steam to heat beer-filled copper kettles. The resulting higher temperatures intensify the aroma and body of beer, resulting in a more flavorful brew.    During Prohibition, the Stroh family operated the business under the name The Stroh Products Company, producing near beer (beer with its alcohol extracted), birch beer, soft drinks, malt products, ice cream, and ice. Though production of most of these items ceased when Prohibition ended in 1933, Stroh Ice Cream can still be enjoyed at parlors today.    The Stroh Brewery grew alongside the other titans of Detroit industry. In 1964 the company made its first move toward expansion when it bought the Goebel Brewing Company, with an eye towards national distribution. As other national brands began to enter the Detroit market, Stroh began to aggressively pursue other markets.    In 1973, Peter Stroh's willingness to depart from years of tradition enabled Stroh's to survive, but the changes were hard to swallow for many Stroh's employees. Stroh broke the company's tradition of family management and recruited managers from other companies. He also introduced a light beer, Stroh's Light.    Though the brewery encountered many difficult times, the tradition and quality of Stroh's has never changed, and the quality of Bernhard's family-owned beer continue today, with Stroh's and Stroh's Light.","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/uV6ou7/upload_dng2E8-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/uV6ou7/upload_dng2E8-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/uV6ou7/upload_dng2E8-large.png","Tampa","","","","","","",""

Stumblefoot is a name that personifies the boot strap and prototyping format we have gone about creating our brewery. The name pays tribute to our willingness to experiment.    We decided to come up with a definition that incorporates the essence of our experience:  Stumblefoot – \’stəm • bəl • fut\ (noun)   1) The art and science of gaining new knowledge through the happenstance of interesting encounters. Fortune favors the prepared.

Although it is strongly liable to the German Purity Law dated 1516 it is different to most other beers, since we are not filtering or pasteurizing it but bring it directly from the brewery to your table.    In order to make your stay a most pleasant one, we serve homemade Swabian delicacies with the freshly brewed beer. You can have a look on our traditional micro brewery directly from your seat in the restaurant and you can join a guided tour upon appointment. There are no separate rooms in our pleasant and friendly pub but we´ll be pleased to reserve the requested number of seats for you in one of our most comfortable places of the pub to make your stay with your friends or collegues most enjoyable.    If you come with a larger group of people you have the opportunity to rent the whole restaurant where we will spoil you with our speciality buffets. It will be a pleasure to help you with the combination of your menue and to create the right atmosphere for your stay. Our catering service will bring our home-made delicacies to ever place you want.

Unlike others that brew “Pale Ale Style”  Our beer is brewed on an Authentic British Pale Ale Brew House using the finest English Pale Ale Malt, American Hops and Yeast.  I have been brewing American Pale Ales since 1982, back in the days when I brewed 20 Liters at a time as a homebrewer.  Today I brew 2000 Liters at a time (more friends then back then).  I grew up in Northern California during the Microbrewery Revolution and you will taste that in my beers. Of course I never pasteurize our beers or add anything artificial.  Trust me when I say, Beer coming from Pfäffikon to your dinner table will taste fresher than beer brought in a container traveling 2 months over the ocean.  Don’t just take our word for it, Biergenuss Magazine calls us “The Rothschild of Beer”. Thanks to all of you for making Western Rider the number one selling Pale Ale in Switzerland. Unlike many other brands, we are not brewed in Germany or in another Kanton and then sold as a “Local” or “Swiss Beer”. We are also not a big beer factory, owned by a European neighbor.  With every Sudwerk Beer, you are enjoying an Authentic Pale Ale produced here in Switzerland, by a family owned and operated “Kleinbrauerei”/Microbrewery. With every Sudwerk Beer, you enjoy the true meaning of Swiss Quality and the results of good old fashioned hard work.  You can find us in larger COOP Stores in the German and French speaking parts of Switzerland, on the Bahnhofstrasse in Jelmoli, Rio Getränke, Drinks of the World as well as in over 100 Restaurants and Hotels. In Zürich, we are distributed by Heineken Distribution, Intercomestibles AG and Schatt Getränke. Quality without compromise. If you are ever in the neighborhood, come by and visit us!

""We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio"" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.    SweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home.

However, they quickly realized their love of baseball was more than equaled by their love of a good drink. Despite the desolate landscape of college get-togethers where there was a strong emphasis on a drink's quantity over quality, Wilson and Tommy were able to find a shared interest in the craft beer industry. When they started an alcoholic beverage company, their adventurous attitudes translated into a desire to create a product that was truly new and exciting. The result was T.W. Pitchers’ Snake Bite®.    While in college, Wilson lived in Europe and discovered that generations of British pub-goers have enjoyed blending lager and hard apple cider. He was astonished to learn the popular concoction had only sparingly made its way across the pond to the United States. Ready to undo this injustice, he returned from his trip and founded W.G. Barr Beverage Company. Tommy was brought on board, and the dynamic duo got to work bringing Snake Bite – a bottled blend of lager and cider - to the thirsty people of America. T.W. Pitchers’, which stands for ""Two Williams Pitchers’,"" or ""Tommy and Wilson, Pitchers,"" was immediately settled on as the brand name.    After months of hard work and many late nights spent taste testing, Wilson and Tommy launched T.W. Pitchers’ Snake Bite in San Francisco. Armed with their Airstream office, a little bit of know-how, and a whole lot of gumption, Wilson and Tommy are committed to quenching your thirst, one bottle of Snake Bite at a time.

The story goes, Wesley was approached by his father, Tim, one day about what he was going to do with his life. As an ocean lifeguard and co-owner of a bar, Wesley thought he had it made. His dad informed him of a trademark he had won in 2004 and subsequently protected in contest from Anheuser Busch. The name was TailGate Beer.    Tim thought TailGate Beer was something special. As an avid sports fan and tailgater, Tim implored Wesley to take his homebrews that people loved drinking and brew TailGate Beer! Wesley, having put himself through college at San Diego State University, grew up modestly. The gift of TailGate Beer was a generous one but, unlike some tales of entrepreneurism, didn’t come with startup funds.    They both agreed the name was solid and the marketing would one day be fun, but Wesley was emphatic that the beer had to be excellent. From there, Wesley took what he liked to brew, and brewed in Southern California. All initial beers were brewed and packaged in kegs and glass bottles. Wesley entered into the Great American Beer Festival in 2007 and although no formal awards were won, TailGate Beer was a hit! This drew lots of attention from beer fans from all over the country. The common response was “great beer!” and “great name!” So with confirmation of Wesley’s biggest apprehension – people loved the beer – TailGate Beer was born.","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PuOZUW/upload_jjOm6o-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PuOZUW/upload_jjOm6o-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/brewery/PuOZUW/upload_jjOm6o-large.png","San Diego","858-215-4842","","2007","","http://tailgatebeer.com/tailgate-newsletter/","",""

The brewery is located in the West Bank village of Taybeh, 35 kilometers north of Jerusalem. It produced its first beer in 1995 and has since developed a global cult following. It has been described as a pioneer microbrewery in the region, being that it predated the first Israeli microbrewery, The Dancing Camel, by about ten years.      Milestones:  By 2005 the company was only able to produce 300 cases a week locally due to conflict with Israel. Taybeh beer sold in Europe is brewed and bottled in Belgium with the license held in Germany.    In 2005, an annual Oktoberfest-style beer festival was launched. Dubbed the Taybeh Beer Festival, it opens in the beginning of October.    In 1997, Taybeh beer became the first Palestinian product to be franchised in Germany, where it was brewed and bottled for sale in Europe. Taybeh beer is also exported directly from Taybeh to Sweden.    In 2008, an Australian named Lara van Raay produced a documentary called Palestine, Beer and Oktoberfest Under Occupation, which focuses on the Taybeh Brewery and the Khoury family.      Products:  There are four varieties of Taybeh Beer: Golden, Light, Amber, and Dark.     In 2007, a new non-alcoholic beer variety was to be launched specifically for the local Palestinian Muslim market.     The original brand was Taybeh Beer Golden. The Taybeh Beer Dark and Taybeh Beer Light were introduced for the 2000 celebrations in the Holy Land. The Dark variety follows a classic style of the way monks brewed beer in the Middle Ages in order to fortify themselves during their fasting.","","","","West Bank","","","","","","",""

This smalltime hobby of making beer in a tiny apartment blossomed into a fulltime career, brewing commercially. Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern California to study Fermentation Science. Upon returning to Salt Lake, he aligned himself with a startup brewery called Uinta Brewing Company. The concept for this startup was to brew the freshest beer available in the State of Utah while limiting the alcohol percentage to 3.2 by weight (4% by volume).
